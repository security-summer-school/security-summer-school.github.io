# file.

# The seek function takes 2 parameters:
#    - offset: The number of bytes to move the cursor. Can be negative to move the cursor back
#    - whence: From where to move the cursor. Can take the following values:
#        - 0: from the beginning of the file
#        - 1: from the cursor's current position
#        - 2: from the end of the file.
