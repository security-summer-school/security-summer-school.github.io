# Executables and Processes

From a user's perspective, the main purpose of the computing system is to run applications.
Applications are used for the user's benefit: listen to music, organize files, play games, develop applications, chat over the Internet, etc.

A running application is called **a process**.
A user starts a process, interacts with a process, ends a process.

When a process runs for the benefit of the user, it **executes instructions** that **operate on data**.
These two items (executing instructions and operating on data) are the most relevant items to understanding processes and executables.
Instructions, also called **code**, and **data** reside in memory.
Code is read from memory by the processor / CPU (*Central Processing Unit*), then it is decoded and interpreted by the CPU, then it is executed on data that is also read from memory by the CPU.
Finally, the result of the operation is stored back into memory.
So, each process has its memory space that stores code and data.

TODO: diagram with memory (code, data) and CPU interaction

We say that each process has its own memory space, also called address space.
We refer to this as **process address space**, or **process virtual address space** ((P)VAS) (why this is named *virtual* is outside the scope of this section).
This space is populated with data and code.
Data is dynamic with respect to contents and size: it can be modified, it can be enlarged or shrinked.
Code is static: it can't be (easily) modified, it can't be (easily) enlarged.
Data can be read from or written to outside the process memory, to outside devices (I/O - *Input/Output*) - keyboard, monitor, network, disk.
Code is however read at process birth time.

The origin of the code and some parts of the data is **the application executable** (or program executable).
The application executable is a binary file with a given format that stores the code and initial data that will be used to set up the process.
The birth of a process means loading the code and initial data from the program executable into memory.
This creates the process virtual address space.
Then the CPU is pointed to execute instructions from the new process virtual address spaces and now the process is running.

TODO: diagram with executable (code, data) and process memory (code, data) + CPU (code + data interaction) + I/O (for parts of data)

We call the starting of a process from a program executable **loading**.
The **loader** is the piece of software responsible for this.
Whatever happens during loading is said to happen during **load-time**.
After the process starts, whatever happens is said to happen at / during **runtime**.

For this session we will first look at the process virtual address space and see how it is updated at runtime.
We will then map that information to the program executable and what's hapenning at load-time.
We will then spend more time dissecting and executable and make the first steps on static analysis, the subject of the [next section](https://github.com/razvand/binary/tree/master/sessions/static-analysis).

## Process Memory Layout

To understand the full picture of program execution it is vital to understand the memory layout of processes from ELF executables.
The kernel provides an interface in `/proc/<PID>/maps` for each process to see how the memory layout looks like.

Let's write a simple Hello World application and investigate.

**IMPORTANT:** Note that we have removed **Address Space Layout Randomization** for these examples.
We'll explain this later.

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	printf("Hello world\n");
	malloc(10000);
	while(1){
		;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

```
$ gcc -Wall hw.c -o hw -m32
$ ./hw  &
[1] 4771
Hello world
$ cat /proc/4771/maps
08048000-08049000 r-xp 00000000 08:06 1843771                            /tmp/hw
08049000-0804a000 r--p 00000000 08:06 1843771                            /tmp/hw
0804a000-0804b000 rw-p 00001000 08:06 1843771                            /tmp/hw
0804b000-0806e000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                                  [heap]
f7ded000-f7dee000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
f7dee000-f7f93000 r-xp 00000000 08:06 917808                             /lib32/libc-2.17.so
f7f93000-f7f95000 r--p 001a5000 08:06 917808                             /lib32/libc-2.17.so
f7f95000-f7f96000 rw-p 001a7000 08:06 917808                             /lib32/libc-2.17.so
f7f96000-f7f99000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
f7fd9000-f7fdb000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
f7fdb000-f7fdc000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0                                  [vdso]
f7fdc000-f7ffc000 r-xp 00000000 08:06 917869                             /lib32/ld-2.17.so
f7ffc000-f7ffd000 r--p 0001f000 08:06 917869                             /lib32/ld-2.17.so
f7ffd000-f7ffe000 rw-p 00020000 08:06 917869                             /lib32/ld-2.17.so
fffdd000-ffffe000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                                  [stack]
```

If we start another process in the background the output for it will be exactly the same as this one.
Why is that? The answer, of course, is virtual memory.
The kernel provides this mechanism through which each process has an address space **completely isolated** from that of other running processes.
They can still communicate using inter-process communication mechanisms provided by the kernel but we won't get into that here.
Shortly put, there would be two processes with the same name and with two **apparently** identical mappings, but still the two programs would be isolated from one another.

An initial schematic of the memory layout would be the following:

![ELF Memory Layout](assets/elf-space.png)

### Executable

As we have seen, there are three memory regions associated with the executable:

```
08048000-08049000 r-xp 00000000 08:06 1843771                            /tmp/hw
08049000-0804a000 r--p 00000000 08:06 1843771                            /tmp/hw
0804a000-0804b000 rw-p 00001000 08:06 1843771                            /tmp/hw
```

From their permissions we can infer what they correspond to:

* `08048000-08049000 r-xp` is the `.text` section along with the rest of the executable parts
* `08049000-0804a000 râ€“p` is the `.rodata` section
* `0804a000-0804b000 rw-p` consists of the `.data`, `.bss` sections and other R/W sections

It is interesting to note that the executable is almost identically mapped into memory.
The only region that is *compressed* in the binary is the `.bss` section.
Let's see this in action by dumping the header of the file:

```
$ hexdump -Cv hw | head

```

### Heap

The heap comes right after the executable at `0x0804b000` and ends at `0x0806e000` which is the current `brk` point.
The memory allocator will increase the `brk` when more allocations are made but will not decrease it when memory is freed so as to reuse the memory regions for future allocations.
The allocator in libc actually keeps a list of past allocations and their sizes.
When future allocations will require the same size as a previously freed region, the allocator will reuse one from this lookup table.
The process is called **binning**.

Let's see how the brk evolves in our executable using strace:

```
$ strace -i -e brk ./hw
[ Process PID=1995 runs in 32 bit mode. ]
[f7ff2314] brk(0)                       = 0x804b000
Hello world
[f7fdb430] brk(0)                       = 0x804b000
[f7fdb430] brk(0x806e000)               = 0x806e000
```

Let's test the fact that the `brk` does not decrease and that future malloc's can reuse previously freed regions:

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	void * buf[15];
	int i;
	for( i = 0 ; i < 15; i++)
		buf[i] = malloc( i * 100) ;

	for( i = 0 ; i < 15; i++)
		free( buf[i] );

	for( i = 0 ; i < 15; i++)
		buf[i] = malloc( i * 100) ;


	return 0;
}
```

```
$ strace -e brk ./hw
[ Process PID=2424 runs in 32 bit mode. ]
brk(0)                              = 0x804b000
brk(0)                              = 0x804b000
brk(0x806c000)                      = 0x806c000

+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

As you can see, only one `brk` call is made.
Furthermore, after the regions are freed they are reused.

**IMPORTANT:** This behaviour of the allocator is important in the **Use After Free** class of vulnerabilities which we will be covering in the next labs.

### Memory Mappings and Libraries

In our example we had the following memory mappings:

```
f7ded000-f7dee000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
f7dee000-f7f93000 r-xp 00000000 08:06 917808                             /lib32/libc-2.17.so
f7f93000-f7f95000 r--p 001a5000 08:06 917808                             /lib32/libc-2.17.so
f7f95000-f7f96000 rw-p 001a7000 08:06 917808                             /lib32/libc-2.17.so
f7f96000-f7f99000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
f7fd9000-f7fdb000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
f7fdb000-f7fdc000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0                                  [vdso]
f7fdc000-f7ffc000 r-xp 00000000 08:06 917869                             /lib32/ld-2.17.so
f7ffc000-f7ffd000 r--p 0001f000 08:06 917869                             /lib32/ld-2.17.so
f7ffd000-f7ffe000 rw-p 00020000 08:06 917869                             /lib32/ld-2.17.so
```

All functions that are called from external libraries *pull* in the whole library into the address space.
As these are also ELF files you can see that they have similar patterns: multiple sections with different permissions just like the main executable.

One more thing to note here is that large calls to `malloc` result in calls to `mmap2`:

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	printf("Hello world\n");
	printf("Small allocation %p\n", malloc(10000));
	printf("Big allocation %p\n", malloc(10000000));
	return 0;
}
```

```
# strace -e brk,mmap2  ./hw_large
[ Process PID=3445 runs in 32 bit mode. ]
brk(0)                                  = 0x804b000
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0xfffffffff7fda000
mmap2(NULL, 265183, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0xfffffffff7f99000
mmap2(NULL, 1747628, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0) = 0xfffffffff7dee000
mmap2(0xf7f93000, 12288, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0x1a5000) = 0xfffffffff7f93000
mmap2(0xf7f96000, 10924, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0xfffffffff7f96000
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0xfffffffff7ded000
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0xfffffffff7fd9000
Hello world
brk(0)                                  = 0x804b000
brk(0x806e000)                          = 0x806e000
Small allocation 0x804b008
mmap2(NULL, 10002432, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0xfffffffff7463000
Big allocation 0xf7463008
```

As expected, the `brk` is increased when the first allocation is made.
However, larger regions are backed by memory mappings.

### Stack

If you observed from previous traces, the `mmap2` call returns addresses towards NULL (lower addresses).
It behaves like this because there is another important memory region called the `stack` that has a fixed size: usually 8 MB.
Since the heap and the mmap region do not have this limit imposed the optimization is to start mmap-ings from a known boundary: the stack end boundary.
Let's put this into perspective.
You can view the current stack limit using `ulimit -s`.

```
$ ulimit -s
8192
$ python
>>> hex(0xffffffff - 8192*1024)
'0xff7fffff'
```

This address is the stack boundary.
It seems odd then that the first mmap in the program above ends at `0xf7ffe000` and not `0xff7fffff`.
This is probably an optimization.

However, we can set the stack size to unlimited and the mmap allocation direction will reverse:

```
$ ulimit -s unlimited
$ strace -e mmap2,brk ./hw_large
[ Process PID=4617 runs in 32 bit mode. ]
brk(0)                                  = 0x804b000
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x55578000
mmap2(NULL, 265183, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0x55579000

```

As you can see, the big allocation is now towards the stack instead of towards the heap.

Returning to the main functionality of the stack, remember from the previous lab that local variables are declared on the stack.
This translates into assembly code in the following way:

```
int main()
{

        char buf[1000];
        int i;
............
}
```

The C snippet would be translated into ASM something like:

```
0804840c <main>:
 804840c:	55                   	push   ebp
 804840d:	89 e5                	mov    ebp,esp
 804840f:	81 ec f0 03 00 00    	sub    esp,0x3f0
..........
```

The `0x3f0` hex value is equal to `1008` in decimal, which is precisely 1000 (from `buf`) + 4 (from `i`) + 4 (the storage of another int that the compiler used later in the code).

As the program subtracts more from `esp` the kernel will provide pages on-demand until the stack boundary or another mmap-ing is hit.
The kernel will, in this case, kill the application because of the Segmentation Fault.

### Segmentation Fault

Now that we know everything about the memory address space we can say more about the infamous `Segmentation Fault` that all of us have, at some time, encountered.
It is basically a permission violation.
Apart from the mappings that appear in `/proc/<PID>/maps` with `r--`, `rw-`, etc, you can consider that everything else is `---`.
Thus, a read access at such a location will violate the permission of that region so the whole app will be killed by the signal received (unless it has a signal handler).
Examples:

* Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer will try to read from `0x00000000` which is not (usually) mapped => `SIGSEGV` (read access on none)
* Writing after the end of a heap buffer (if the heap buffer is exactly at the end of a mapping) will determine writes into unmapped pages => SIGSEGV (write access on none)
* Trying to write to `.rodata` => SIGSEGV (write access on read only)
* Overwriting the stack with "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" will also overwrite the return address and make the execution go to `0x41414141` => SIGSEGV (execute access on none)
* Overwriting the stack and return address with another address to a shellcode on the stack => SIGSEGV (execute access on read/write only)
* Trying to rewrite the binary (`int *v = main; *v = 0x90909090;`) => SIGSEGV (write access on read/execute only)

## Tutorials

This session is focused on the transformation of an **ELF file** (stored on disk) as it is loaded into memory and becomes **a process** (stored into memory).
We will first analyze the structure of an **ELF file** and how this structure evolves when going from **C source code**, to **object file** and then to either **an executable** or **a shared library**.
We will also skim over how various elements are interpreted by the **linker** and the **loader**.
Finally, we will see the layout of a process once it is loaded into memory.

### Big Picture View

Sun Microsystems' SunOS came up with the concept of dynamic shared libraries and introduced it to UNIX in the late 1980s.
UNIX System V Release 4, which Sun co-developed, introduced the ELF object format adaptation from the Sun scheme.
Later it was developed and published as part of the ABI (Application Binary Interface) as an improvement over COFF, the previous object format and by the late 1990s it had become the standard for UNIX and UNIX-like systems including Linux and BSD derivatives.
Depending on processor architectures, several specifications have emerged with minor changes, but for this session we will be focusing on the [ELF-32](http://www.skyfree.org/linux/references/ELF_Format.pdf) format.

![Linking View and Execution View](assets/elf-link-exec.png)

The structure of an ELF file during the linking process is the same with that of an object file.
The linking process involves collecting and combining code and data into a single file that will later be loaded into memory and executed.
On the right hand side we can see how the the ELF file structure will be transformed in memory.
**Sections** instruct the Linker while **Segments** instruct the Operating System.

![ELF Merging](assets/elf-merging.png)

As we can see, the information inside the two program headers and the section headers gets merged as needed inside the more familiar program segments.
The basic role of the ELF file format is to serve as a roadmap for the linker and the OS Loader to generate a running process.

### Static/Dynamic linking

Out of practical considerations, for very large programs, even early on, it was very impractical to store all of the source code inside a single file.
One of the most mundane of all actions, namely splitting your source code into functions across multiple files while still obtaining a valid running program was a difficult engineering challenge.
The initial paradigm was called **static linking** and was the only option inside the COFF file format.
It involves interpreting each piece of code from each file and then merging all the information inside a single binary that would contain all the machine code necessary for the program.
This way of doing things, still in use today, involves loading all of the code and data into memory regardless of use case.
This basically meant that, the required resources to run a program were determined by the number of instances, with no possibility of optimization.
Running 10 instances of the same program meant that there was a lot of code duplication going on in the memory space.

![ELF Static Linking](assets/elf-static-linking.png)

Along with the ELF format came a new way of doing things.
Instead of linking all the source files that contained subroutines into the final binaries, separate binaries were organized in libraries that could be loaded per use case, on demand.
Essentially, the libraries were loaded only once into memory and when a program instance required a subroutine from a specific library it would inquire a special OS component about it and new resources would be allocated only for the volatile parts of the library image (`.bss` and `.data`).
The new process allowed for a much more efficient resource utilization and was named dynamic linking and the new type of library files were called shared objects.
Running 10 instances of the same program now meant that only the volatile parts of those binaries would be duplicated.
In cases where the same code can be reused, it is allocated only once and used by multiple instances of the same program.

![ELF Dynamic Linking](assets/elf-dynamic-linking.png)

### ELF Types

There are several ELF types but the most common types we will be dealing with are:

* Relocatable Files
* Shared Objects
* Executable Files

#### ELF Type - Relocatable Files

Relocatable files are obtained using the core compiler and basically contain all the ELF information necessary except for data like external variables or subroutines that are present in other files.

```
gcc -c -o reloc.o source.c
gcc -c -fPIC -o reloc.o source.c
```

The first command will produce a relocatable file that will later constitute an executable or a static library.
If we want to use the relocatable file to later create a shared library we need to use the second variant to create a relocatable file that has [Position Independent Code](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/Introduction_to_Position_Independent_Code) (PIC).

#### ELF Type - Shared Objects

Shared libraries are loaded up at runtime as needed by an OS component named the dynamic loader.
Shared objects may include other shared objects and this aspect is very important because, when loading specific subroutines, the ELF file must provide its dependencies.
As such, the process of dynamic linking does a breadth first search gradually building the full dependency list.

![Shared Objects](assets/elf-dependency.png)

You can view the list of shared object dependencies for any given binary as well as the addresses where they will be loaded in memory by using the `ldd` command.

```
ldd /bin/ls
	linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0x00e02000)
	librt.so.1 => /lib/tls/i686/cmov/librt.so.1 (0x004f9000)
	libselinux.so.1 => /lib/libselinux.so.1 (0x00c62000)
	libacl.so.1 => /lib/libacl.so.1 (0x00a87000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libc.so.6 (0x00110000)
	libpthread.so.0 => /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libpthread.so.0 (0x00325000)
	/lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x00a45000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libdl.so.2 (0x0077d000)
	libattr.so.1 => /lib/libattr.so.1 (0x00dd7000)
```

All libraries should adhere to a strict naming convention.
Shared objects have two names:

* **soname** - that consists of the prefix `lib`, followed by the library name, then a `.so`, another dot, then the major version (e.g. `libtest.so.1`)
* **real name** - is actually a file name, that usually extends the **soname** by adding a dot and minor version number along with the release version (e.g. `libtest.so.1.23.3`)

Additionally, each library source file should have an accompanying header file with the extension `.h` and the same name.

Adhering to these naming conventions is quite important as dependencies are resolved based on the **soname**.

```
gcc -c -fPIC libtesting.c
ld -shared -soname libtesting.so.1 -o libtesting.so.1.0 -lc libtesting.o
ldconfig -v -n .
ln -sf libtesting.so.1 libtesting.so
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
gcc -o main_program main_program.c -L. -ltesting
```

The first line creates an object file with position independent code.
The second line will create the shared object with **soname** `libtesting.so.1` and a real file name of `libtesting.so.1.0` by using the linker.
Shared objects are usually installed in other directories but the line containing `ldconfig`, will install it in the current directory.
At runtime the standard directories like `/usr/lib` are searched, but we add the local directory to the search path by modifying the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.

Finally, the executable is created by dynamic linking against the shared object.

A good tutorial on how to create a basic shared object can be found [here](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-shobj/).

#### ELF Type - Executable Files

They are regarded as the end result and contain all the information necessary to create a running process.


### ELF Structure

The following wiki sections on ELF structure are dense and are **not** meant to be known by heart.
**Do not** try to read them all at once and memorize them, but rather use the following chapters as **reference**.

Tools of the trade are:

* readelf
* objdump
* ldd
* Ghidra/IDA (Ghidra is Open Source, while IDA is not and it is really expensive)

The command outputs that follow are rather large so we will only be discussing the less obvious parts.
We will also leave out information that's not really that important or generally weird.

#### ELF Header

Using `readelf` is straight-forward enough:

```
readelf -h program

ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  Class:                             ELF32
  Data:                              2's complement, little endian
  Version:                           1 (current)
  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:                       0
  Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)
  Machine:                           Intel 80386
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x8048330
  Start of program headers:          52 (bytes into file)
  Start of section headers:          4392 (bytes into file)
  Flags:                             0x0
  Size of this header:               52 (bytes)
  Size of program headers:           32 (bytes)
  Number of program headers:         8
  Size of section headers:           40 (bytes)
  Number of section headers:         30
  Section header string table index: 27
```

Below we will discuss the less evident aspects of the above output

* **Elf Identification** (16 bytes)
  * **Magic** - the first bytes of the binary that identify the file as ELF
  * **Class** - identifies the type of ELF (ex: ELF-32, ELF-64)
  * **Data** - specifies the type of data encoding
  * **Version** - version of the ELF header
  * **OS/ABI** - version of the OS
  * **ABI** - version of the ABI specification
* **Type** - Relocatable, Executable, Shared Object
* **Machine** - Required Machine architecture to run the executable
* **Entry Point Address** - the memory address where the OS loader transfers control to the process code for the first time.
* **Start of Program Headers** - File offset where the array of program headers start
* **Start of Section Headers** - File offset where the array of section headers starts
* **Section Header String Table Index** - the index in the section table name where the information about the section name string table can be found

#### Program Headers

**Program Headers** are only present inside **Executable** and **Shared Object** files.

Again, `readelf` is used with minimum syntax:

```
readelf -l program

Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)
Entry point 0x8048330
There are 8 program headers, starting at offset 52

The **Program Header** table features an array of structures that shows how parts of the file will be mapped into memory at runtime.
The last parts of the output show what sections will be merged into various program headers before loading the ELF into memory and becoming segments.

* **Type**
  * **PHDR** - information about the program header table itself
  * **INTERP** - information about the null terminated string that specifies the path to the dynamic loader.
    This header is only present in executable that use shared object code
  * **LOAD** - use to specify a general purpose loadable segment
  * **DYNAMIC** - information necessary to the dynamic linking process
* **Offset** - offset from the beginning of the file where the segment begins
* **VirtAddr** - the address where the segment will start in memory
* **FileSz** - number of bytes occupied by the segment on disk
* **MemSiz** - number of bytes occupied by the segment in memory
* **Align** - specifies a boundary to which the segments are aligned on file and in memory

Here are two resources to read about [GNU_RELRO](https://www.airs.com/blog/archives/189) and [GNU_STACK](https://guru.multimedia.cx/pt_gnu_stack/) **Program Headers**.

#### Section Table

Section headers are the central piece of reference used to organize the ELF files both on disk and in memory.

```
readelf -S program
There are 30 section headers, starting at offset 0x1128:

```

* **Name** - is obtained by reading the value of the section names table at the specified index
* **Type**
  * **PROGBITS** - information that is given meaning by the program when loaded into memory
  * **NOBITS** - similar to PROGBITS in meaning but occupies no space in the file
  * **STRTAB** - contains the program string table
  * **SYMTAB** - contains the symbol table
  * **DYNAMIC** - holds information necessary for dynamic linking
  * **DYNSYM** - holds a set of symbols used in the dynamic linking process
  * **REL** - holds relocation entries
* **Addr** - if the section is part of an executable it will hold the virtual address where the section could be found in memory.
  If not it would be 0.
* **Off** - offset from the beginning of the file to where the section starts
* **Size** - size of the section in bytes
* **ES** - size in bytes per entry, if fixed entry size is used
* **FLG**
* **X** - contains executable code
* **W** - contains writable code
* **A** - will be loaded into memory as-is during process execution
* **Al** - section alignment constraints

The **Inf** and **Lnk** columns have specific interpretations depending on the section type, as can be seen in the following image:

![ELF Sections Inf and Lnk](assets/elf-sect-inf.png)

Additionally, the raw contents of each section can be dumped using both `objdump` and `readelf`.

```
readelf -x .got program

Hex dump of section '.got':
  0x08049ff0 00000000                            ....
```

```
objdump -s -j ".got"  program

program:     file format elf32-i386

Contents of section .got:
 8049ff0 00000000                             ....
```

For more details about the kind of data stored by ELF sections, refer to this [resource](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/specialsections.html).

When trying to dump contents of section using readelf you can interpret the output like strings by using the `-p` flag.

#### Symbol Table

One of the initial goals of the ELF format was to enable dynamic linking.
Given the machine code of a binary, various elements inside it will use absolute addresses that are based on the memory address where the binary expects to be loaded.
The entire idea of shared libraries is that these can be loaded and unloaded on demand inside the memory space of whichever process needs them at whichever address is available.
As such, a map of how to locate and relocate absolute data points inside the machine code is needed and that's where the symbol table comes in.

```
readelf -s libtesting.so.1

Symbol table '.dynsym' contains 8 entries:
   Num:    Value  Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name

```

Some information on the symbols that may belong to external files or may be referenced by external files during dynamic linking are copied in the `.dynsym` section.

* Name - symbol name
* Type
  * NoType - not specified
  * FUNC - the symbol influences a function
  * SECTION - associated with a section
  * FILE - a symbol that references a files
* Bind
  * LOCAL - the symbol information is not visible outside the object file
  * GLOBAL - the symbol is visible to all the files being combined to form the executable
* Size - the size of the symbol in bytes or 0 if it is unknown
* Ndx
  * UND - unspecified section reference
  * COM - unallocated C external variable
  * ABS - an absolute value for the reference
  * value - an index into the section table
* Value - if the symbol table is part of an executable, the value will contain a memory address where the symbol resides.
  Otherwise it will contain an offset from the beginning of the section referenced by Ndx or O.

As you can see, the symbol table as it appears in object files compiled with gcc is quite verbose, revealing function names and visibility as well as variable scopes, names and even sizes.
In its default form it even shows the name of the sourcefile.

In order to subvert Reverse Engineering attempts you can check out some of the methods of stripping the symbol table of valuable information:

* [A Whirlwind Tutorial on Creating Really Teensy ELF Executables for Linux](http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html)
* [strip](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/strip.html)

#### Relocations

Relocations were a concept that was present ever since the invention of static linking.
The initial purpose of relocations was to give the static linker a roadmap when combining multiple object files into a binary by stating:

* The **Symbol** that needs to be fixed.
* **Where** you can find the symbol (file/section offset).
* An **Algorithm** for making the fixes.

The fixes would usually be made in the `.data` and `.text` sections and everything was well.
Dynamic runtime brought a bit of a complication to modifications that needed to be made in the code segments.
The whole idea of shared libraries is that the code can be loaded once into memory from an ELF file then shared among all the processes that use the library.
The only way to reliably do this is to make the code section read-only.

In order to compensate for this constraint a special data section called the **GOT** (Global Offset Table) was created.
When the code needs to work with a symbol that belongs to shared object, in the code entry for that symbol uses addresses from the **GOT** table.
First time the symbol is referenced the dynamic linker corrects the entry in GOT and on subsequent calls the correct address will be used.

When implementing calls to subroutines in shared objects, a different table is used called the **PLT** (Procedure Linkage Table).
The initial call is made to a stub sequence in the **PLT** which bounces off a **GOT** entry in order to push the subroutine name on the stack and then calls the resolver (mentioned in the **INTERP** program header).

Relocations and how they get applied are very complex topic and we will only try to cover as far is helps detecting file and symbol types If you want to read more you can refer to some of these resources:

```
readelf -r libdynamic.o

```


* **Offset** - In relocatable files and linked shared objects it contains the offset from the beginning of the section , where the relocation needs to be applied
* **Info** - This field is used to derive the index in the symbol table to the affected symbol as well as the algorithm needed for fixing.
  * `info >> 8` - symbol table index
  * `info & 0xff` - algorithm type as defined in the documentation

`readelf` is nice enough to interpret the symbol table for us and gives us the relocation algorithm in the **Type** field and also the symbol name and value as defined in the symbol table.

By looking at the types of relocations we can draw some basic conclusions about the symbol types and also about the files.

* Relocatable Files
  * **R_386_32** - usually used to reference changes to a local symbol
  * **R_386_PC32** - reference a relative distance from here to the symbol
* Relocatable Files for Shared object
  * **R_386_GOTOFF** - usually found in the code area, describes the offset from the beginning of GOT to a local symbol
  * **R_386_GOT32** - also speicific to the code area.
    These entries persist in the linkage phase
  * **R_386_PLT32** - used when describing calls to global subroutines.
    when the linker will read this information it will generate an entry in the GOT and PLT tables
  * **R_386_GOTPC** - used in function to calculate the start address of the GOT
* Executables that use Dynamic Linking
  * **R_386_JMP** - the dynamic linker will deposit the address of the external subroutine during execution
  * **R_386_COPY** - the address of global variable from shared object will be deposited here
* Shared Object Files
  * **R_386_JMP** - the dynamic linker will deposit the address of the external subroutine from one of the shared object dependencies during execution
  * **R_386_GLOB_DATA** - used to deposit the address of a global symbol defined in one of the shared object dependencies
  * **R_386_RELATIVE** - at link time all the R_386_GOTOFF entries are fixed and these relocation will contain absolute addresses

**IMPORTANT:** Executable files that are statically linked do not contain relocations.

## Challenges

Challenges can be found in the `activities/` directory.

### 01. Binary Puzzle

Now that you know some stuff let's see how fast you can solve a 4 piece puzzle!

You are given 4 relocatable object files.
Examine their structure carefully and figure out what each of them is meant to be and how you can link them to create a valid binary.

All conventions regarding shared object names have been respected.

Hints:

* Use `nm` to investigate the files, determine what pieces you need to put together and then link them with `gcc`.
* Check whether the files are compiled for 32 bits or for 64 bits and use the proper `gcc` command.

If you do it correctly you will get an executable that you can run and get the following output:

```
Congratulations
extern var1 10 at 0x565fe020
extern var2  at 0x565fe030
extern var3 99 at 0x565fe024
local var4 0 at 0xffd532ac
g(): not really external
```

### 02. Case of the Missing Function

This task contains a helpless little binary that has lost one of its functions.
Analyze the symbol dependencies as well as the code inside the binary.
Figure out a way to reunite the binary with its missing function.

You cannot modify any of the binaries in order to solve this task.

Hints:

* Run the file, check what it is missing and build the missing component.
  Use `nm` to determine what symbols should be part of the missing component.
* Use `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.` to run an executable file and load a shared library file from the current folder.

### 03. Memory Dump Analysis

Using your newfound voodoo skills you are now able to tackle the following task.
In the middle of two programs I added the following lines:

```
{
	int i;
	int *a[1];
	for( i = 0 ; i < 20; i++)
		printf("%p\n", a[i]);
}
```

The results were the following, respectively:

```
0x804853b
0x1
0x8048530
(nil)
(nil)
0xf7e0ace5
0x1
0xffffce64
0xffffce6c
0xf7ffcfc0
0x1c
(nil)
0xf7fda4c8
0x2
0xffffce60
0xf7f94e54
(nil)
(nil)
(nil)
0xd545cf8d
```

And:

```
0xbfffe7d0
0xd696910
0x80484a9
0xb7fffbe8
0x3
0xb7ffefc0
0xb7df6a84
0x1
0xb7fdc780
0xb7fe75fc
0x804c008
0xb7e59195
0x804c008
0xb7fdb000
0xb7fdc000
0x1
0xffffffff
0x3
(nil)
0xf3b9a5b
```

Try to tell:

* Which was running on a pure 32 bit system
* Which values from the stack traces are from the `.text` region
* Which do not point to valid memory addresses
* Which point to the stack
* Which point to the library/mmap zone

### 04. Compiler Flags

Use proper compiler/linker flags/options to create a running executable for `flag1.o` and `caller.c` and for `flag2.o` and `caller.c`.
Submit the flag [on the platform](https://sss-ctf.security.cs.pub.ro/challenges).

It's the same flag, it's just to make sure you are able to find the flag with both formats of the `flag*.o` object files.

### 05. Print Flag

Someone has tampered with the executable file `get_message`.
Please fix this.
There should be a flag message printed in case you solve it correctly.

You will need to modify the executable.
We recommend you install and use [Bless](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/bless).

What actions does the program do? What functions does it invoke? What should it invoke?

Follow the actions from the entry point in the ELF file and see what is the spot where the program doesn't do what it should.

### 06. Matryoshka

Look carefully inside the `matryoshka` executable.
The flag is there, but inside something else.

Submit the flag [on the platform](https://sss-ctf.security.cs.pub.ro/challenges).

### Bonus: 07. Fix Me

You are given a binary that was stored on a USB stick in space where it was hit by gamma rays thus altering its content.
Fortunately, because the executable is so small, the only area damaged is the ELF header.
Fix it and run it!

The structure of an ELF file is briefly presented here: http://i.imgur.com/m6kL4Lv.png

A more detailed explaination of the ELF header is presented here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#Program_header

The entry point address should be `0x8048054`.
