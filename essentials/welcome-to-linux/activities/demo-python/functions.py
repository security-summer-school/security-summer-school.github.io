    This is a docstring comment. They are used in order to document the
    behaviour of functions an classes in Python. You may see them often.
    They typically look like this:

    Replicates a given string by a given number of times.

        Parameters:
            s (str): the string to replicate
            n (int): the number of times to replicate it. 3 by default

        Returns:
	    String made up of s replicated n times

# We can also specify any function parameter by name, like so:
my_replicated_string = replicate(s=my_string, n=2)
print(f'New returned string is: {my_replicated_string}')

# The print function can also take some default parameters, such as end:
# end is the string to be placed at the end of what's printed.
# By default it's \n.
print(my_string, end="$$$\n")  # This now prints 'SSS Rulz!'$$$

# Similarly, range also takes 2 default parameters: start=0 and step=1.
# As a result, its signature could look like this:
def range(end, start=0, step=1):
    pass  # we can use this keyword when we want to leave functions unimplemented

# Functions can also have multiple return variables
