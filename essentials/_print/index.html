It contains information available to participants: session content, slides, activities support files.
Apart from SSS participants, you can use this content by yourself to learn more about <strong>Security Essentials</strong>.</p><h2 id=using-the-content>Using the Content</h2><p>As with all SSS tracks, the <strong>Security Essentials</strong> track consists of multiple sessions.
One session typically covers a particular topic of the track.
Ideally you would go through the sessions orderly, but you can jump ahead to a topic of interest.</p><p>Each session has its own folder.
The <code>README.md</code> file from a session folder details the topic of the session and includes practical demos of tools and snippets of code.</p><p>After reading the session contents, jump to the hands-on activities.
A typical activity will challenge you to solve / exploit a given issue and obtain a flag.

One such OS is <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Linux>Kali Linux</a>, which is specially designed for security enthusiasts.
This means that Kali comes with a few hundred preinstalled apps that are useful for anywone working in or learning about security.
We&rsquo;ll be using some of these apps throughout this track.</p><h2 id=setting-up-your-kali-virtual-machine>Setting up Your Kali Virtual Machine</h2><ol><li>Start downloading the <a href=https://security.cs.pub.ro/summer-school/wiki/_media/session/infrastructure/sss-kali-amd64.ova.torrent>Kali VM Image</a> torrent.</li><li>Download the VirtualBox installer for your system from <a href=https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>here</a>.</li><li>Install VirtualBox using the installer you downloaded at step 2.</li><li>Start VirtualBox.</li><li>When the download started at step 1 finishes, press the <strong>Import</strong> button.</li><li>Select the downloaded <code>.ova</code> file (the VM image) in the newly opened window.</li><li>Click <strong>Import</strong>.

Try it now!
The dark box that has appeared is called a <strong>terminal</strong>.
A terminal is a means by which we can tell the operating system what to do for us.
In other words, we use the terminal in order to give <strong>commands</strong> to the operating system using a text interface, without the use of a mouse or fancy graphics.
Hence the terminal&rsquo;s alternative name: the <strong>Command Line Interface (CLI)</strong>.
What you&rsquo;ve been using until now, namely navigating the desktop environment by clicking on shortcuts, files and links is called the <strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</strong>.</p><p>Here are a few useful key shortcuts for navigating the terminal more easily:</p><ul><li>open another terminal window: <code>Shift + Alt + t</code>;</li><li>navigate between open terminal windows: <code>Alt + N</code>, where <code>N</code> is the index of the tab you want to switch to <strong>(starting from 1)</strong>;</li><li>close the current window: <code>Ctrl + d</code>;</li><li>copy text from the terminal: <code>Ctrl + Shift + c</code>;</li><li>paste text to the terminal: <code>Ctrl + Shift + v</code>.</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s kind of like a web browser, if you think about it, but with different key combinations.
Don&rsquo;t worry about memorising them now, though.
You&rsquo;ll get plenty of time to practice them in today&rsquo;s activities and in the sessions to come.
For more terminal shortcuts, see the section <a href=#more-terminal-shortcuts>More Terminal Shortcuts</a> below.</p><h4 id=the-prompt>The Prompt</h4><p>Note that the line begins with <code>root@kali:~#</code>.
This is what is called a <strong>prompt</strong>.
It&rsquo;s like a sign that the current terminal is waiting for commands to execute.</p><p>The format of the prompt is the following:</p><pre><code>user@host_name: current_working_directory #
</code></pre><p>Now let&rsquo;s look at each of these components one by one.</p><ul><li><code>user</code> is the name of the current user.
In our case, it says <code>root</code>.
We&rsquo;ll see what this means in its dedicated <a href=#the-root-user>section</a> below.
We chan check that the user truly is <code>root</code> using the command <code>whoami</code>:</li></ul><pre><code>root@kali:~# whoami
root
</code></pre><ul><li><code>host_name</code> is the name of the current system.
Once again, we can check if <code>kali</code> truly is our hostname by running the command <code>hostname</code></li></ul><pre><code>root@kali:~# hostname
kali
</code></pre><ul><li><code>#</code> is a sign that tells us that the prompt is over and that you can start typing commands.
It can also be <code>$</code> or <code>></code>.</li><li><code>current_working_directory</code> is the <strong>path</strong> in the file system where we are currently located.
If this sounds confusing, don&rsquo;t worry.
We&rsquo;ll explain the file hierarchy right now.</li></ul><h4 id=the-file-system>The File System</h4><p>One of the most important things when we&rsquo;re using the CLI and after hacking a remote system is to know where we are in its file hierarchy.
This hierarchy is more commonly known as the <strong>file system</strong>.
The path separator in Linux is <code>/</code>, unlike Windows, where it&rsquo;s <code>\</code>.
At the same time, <code>/</code> is the root of the file system.</p><p>The file hierarchy looks like this:</p><p><img src=./assets/sample_file_hierarchy.svg alt="Sample File Hierarchy"></p><p>Going back to the <code>current_working_directory</code> in the prompt, the terminal can also be seen as a file walker.
This means that at each moment it is &ldquo;placed&rdquo; in a certain directory, i.e. at some point in the file hierarcy.
We can see that the prompt shows <code>~</code>. This stands for <strong>the home directory of the current user</strong>.
Our current user is <code>root</code> and its home directory is <code>/root</code>.
Let&rsquo;s check this by running the command <code>pwd</code> (print working directory):</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# pwd
/root
</code></pre><h4 id=traversing-the-file-system>Traversing the File System</h4><p>Great!
So now we know <strong>where</strong> we are in the file system.
Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s here in <code>/root</code>.
For this, we use <code>ls</code>, that simply lists the contents of the current directory:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# ls
Desktop    ghidra_9.1.2_PUBLIC  peda      %SystemDrive%
Documents  libc-database        Pictures  Templates
Downloads  Music                Public    Videos
</code></pre><p>That&rsquo;s quite a bit of stuff, but there&rsquo;s no need to look into each of these now.
Let&rsquo;s focus on navigating the file system for now.</p><p>Almost every linux command, such as <code>ls</code>, can take various parameters that alter its behaviour.
<code>ls</code> for instance can list any given directory, not just the current directory.
This reqiures the use of the path to list as a parameter:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# ls /  # list the contents of the / (root) directory
0     dev   initrd.img      lib32   lost+found  proc  sbin  tmp  vmlinuz
bin   etc   initrd.img.old  lib64   media       root  srv   usr  vmlinuz.old
boot  home  lib             libx32  opt         run   sys   var
root@kali:~# ls /media  # list the contents of the /media directory
cdrom  cdrom0
</code></pre><p>Notice the second <code>#</code> symbol in each command.
This one is different from the one in the prompt.
It marks the beginning of a comment, just like <code>//</code> does in C.</p><p>So we can now see what a given directory contains, but we&rsquo;re still stuck in <code>/root</code>.
Let&rsquo;s change our current directory. For this, we use <code>cd</code>:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# ls libc-database/  # list the contents of libc-database
add  common  db  dump  find  get  identify  README.md  tmp
root@kali:~# cd libc-database/  # move to libc-database
root@kali:~/libc-database# ls  # list the contetns of the current directory (now libc-database)
add  common  db  dump  find  get  identify  README.md  tmp
root@kali:~/libc-database# pwd  # check that we really are in libc-database
/root/libc-database
</code></pre><p>Notice the prompt change to <code>~/libc-database</code> after <code>cd</code> because the current directory changes.</p><p>Stop!
<strong><code>Tab</code> Time!</strong>
Almost every CLI is capable of autocompletion and that of Linux is no different.
Type <code>cd l</code> and then press <code>Tab</code>.
Notice that the rest of the directory&rsquo;s name has been autofilled: <code>cd libc-database/</code>.
Now type <code>cd D</code> and press <code>Tab</code> <strong>twice</strong>.
Notice that 3 options have appeared.
What happened is that the terminal found 3 directories that start with <code>D</code> and is asking you for more information.
Type <code>e</code> and press <code>Tab</code> once more.
Now the terminal sees there is only one option, <code>Desktop/</code> and autofills it for you.</p><p><code>Tab</code> allows you to use the terminal very efficiently.
It&rsquo;s one of the most powerful tools at our disposal, so remember to abuse it as much as possible.
<strong>Keep in mind: there is no such thing as pressing <code>Tab</code> too many times</strong>.</p><p>Now back to our directories.
So we&rsquo;re in <code>libc-database</code>, but how do we get back to <code>/root</code>?
Similarly to a browser, the parent of any directory can be accessed using <code>..</code> like so:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~/libc-database# ls ..
Desktop    ghidra_9.1.2_PUBLIC  peda      %SystemDrive%
Documents  libc-database        Pictures  Templates
Downloads  Music                Public    Videos
root@kali:~/libc-database# cd ..
root@kali:~# ls
Desktop    ghidra_9.1.2_PUBLIC  peda      %SystemDrive%
Documents  libc-database        Pictures  Templates
Downloads  Music                Public    Videos
root@kali:~# pwd
/root
</code></pre><p>Makes sense? Alright. So now we can move anywhere.
We can chain paths using the separator (<code>/</code>), even adding <code>..</code>, like so:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~/libc-database# cd ../..  # we are in /root/libc-database
root@kali:/# ls  # now we are 2 levels up, in /
0     dev   initrd.img      lib32   lost+found  proc  sbin  tmp  vmlinuz
bin   etc   initrd.img.old  lib64   media       root  srv   usr  vmlinuz.old
boot  home  lib             libx32  opt         run   sys   var
</code></pre><h4 id=be-a-man>Be a Man!</h4><p>Almost every Linux command comes with extensive documentation.
This documentation can be read using <code>man &lt;command></code>.
Let&rsquo;s try reading the manual page for the <code>ls</code> command:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# man ls
</code></pre><ul><li>Use <code>↑</code> and <code>↓</code> to scroll up and down.</li><li>Use <code>Space</code> to scroll one whole page down.</li><li>Use <code>/&lt;string></code> to search for any string.
Try searching for the string &ldquo;recursive&rdquo;.
Use <code>n</code> to navigate to the next occurrence of your string and <code>Shfit + n</code> to navigate to the previous one.</li><li>Use <code>q</code> to quit the manual</li></ul><p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Use the parameter you&rsquo;ve just found to recurisively list the contents of the <code>/root/libc-database</code> directory, using both relative and absolute paths.</p><p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Use the man page for <code>ls</code> again to learn how to view the contents of a directory in the form of a <strong>long listing</strong>.
This parameter will show you more details regarding a file, such as its type, size, owner, access rights, the date when it was last modified etc.
Test it on the file <code>/root/libc-database/README.md</code></p><p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Use the man page for <code>ls</code> to find out what parameter to pass to <code>ls</code> to list <strong>all</strong> entries in a directory.
This option will also show you the <strong>hidden</strong> files in that directory.
These files start with <code>.</code>.
Test it on the <code>~</code> directory.
Notice our friend <code>..</code> is also present.</p><h4 id=ill-make-my-own-hierarchy>I&rsquo;ll Make My Own Hierarchy!</h4><p>In order to create directories we use the <code>mkdir</code> command:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# mkdir demo
root@kali:~# ls
demo     Documents  ghidra_9.1.2_PUBLIC  Music  Pictures  %SystemDrive%  Videos
Desktop  Downloads  libc-database        peda   Public    Templates
root@kali:~# cd demo
root@kali:~/demo# 
</code></pre><p>Now let&rsquo;s create a file in our new directory.
For this, we use the <code>touch</code> command.
It creates an <strong>empty</strong> file.</p><pre><code>root@kali:~/demo# touch demo-file
root@kali:~/demo# ls
demo-file
root@kali:~/demo# cat demo-file  # The file is empty, so nothing is printed.
root@kali:~/demo# touch demo-file2  # Just because we can.
root@kali:~/demo# ls
demo-file  demo-file2
</code></pre><p>In order to remove a file, we use the <code>rm</code> command.</p><pre><code>root@kali:~/demo# rm demo-file2
root@kali:~/demo# ls
demo-file
</code></pre><p>Now let&rsquo;s try to remove our directory the same way.</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# rm demo
rm: cannot remove 'demo': Is a directory
</code></pre><p>Deleting a directory requires that an extra parameter be passed to <code>rm</code>.
Find it in <code>rm</code>&rsquo;s <code>man</code> page.
Look for the string &ldquo;recursively&rdquo;.
Yup, it&rsquo;s <code>-r</code> (or <code>-R</code>, or <code>--recursive</code>; all three work).</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# rm -r demo/
root@kali:~# ls
Desktop    ghidra_9.1.2_PUBLIC  peda      %SystemDrive%
Documents  libc-database        Pictures  Templates
Downloads  Music                Public    Videos
</code></pre><p>All clean!</p><h4 id=absolute-or-relative>Absolute or Relative?</h4><p>There are two ways of expressing a file path: relative and absolute.
<strong>Relative</strong> paths are called so because they refer to the current directoy.</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# cd libc-database/
</code></pre><p>This command uses a <strong>relative</strong> path, as <code>libc-database</code> only exists in <code>/root</code> (<code>~</code>).
If we were to run it from <code>/bin</code> for instance, it wouldn&rsquo;t work because there is no <code>libc-datbase</code> directory in <code>/bin</code>.</p><p><strong>Absolute</strong> paths however can be used from anywhere in the filesystem.
They contain the full path to the file, starting from the root of the file system (<code>/</code>):</p><pre><code>root@kali:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security# cd /root/libc-database/
root@kali:~/libc-database# pwd
/root/libc-database
</code></pre><p>In the snippet above, we were able to navigate to <code>/root/libc-database</code> from somewhere completely different in the hierarchy.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s get some practice:</p><ul><li>Navigate to <code>/usr/lib/dpkg/methods/apt/</code>, but don&rsquo;t just copy and paste this path.
Use <code>Tab</code> and you&rsquo;ll barely have to type anything.</li><li>Now get back to <code>root</code>&rsquo;s home using the home directory shortcut.</li><li>Navigate to <code>~/ghidra_9.1.2_PUBLIC/docs/images</code> using its absolute path.</li><li>Now move 2 levels up the hierarchy without retyping the path.
Use <code>..</code>.</li></ul><h4 id=inspecting-file-contents>Inspecting File Contents</h4><p>Up to this point, we&rsquo;ve learned how to traverse the file system.
Now we need to be able to <em>inspect</em> the files themselves.
The simplest ways to view the contents of a file in the terminal is the <code>cat</code> command:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# cat /etc/hostname 
kali
</code></pre><p>As you&rsquo;ve probably guessed, <code>/etc/hostname</code> is the file where the machine&rsquo;s host name is stored.</p><p>Feel free to consult <code>cat</code>&rsquo;s man page for further details about the command.
We&rsquo;ll introduce more advanced means of outputting the contents of a file in the session dedicated to <a href=../data-representation>Data Representation</a>.
Stay tuned!</p><h3 id=the-root-user>The Root User</h3><p>As we said previously, the prompt may indicate the current user, in our case <code>root</code>.
But what exactly is this user?
Well, Linux systems admit multiple levels of user privileges.
These privileges refer to the actions a certain user is allowed to perform, such as installing other apps or reading various files.</p><p>But among all users, there is <em>one to rule them all</em>: <code>root</code>.
Similar to the <code>Administrator</code> user in Windows, <code>root</code> has no restrictions to the actions he may perform.
This is the default user in Kali Linux, so you don&rsquo;t need to worry about permissions.
However, when logging into the remote servers we provide for some of the CTF challenges below, the user will be <code>ctf</code> and it <strong>does</strong> have limited permissions.</p><h3 id=processes>Processes</h3><p>Now that we&rsquo;ve learned how to use the terminal, let&rsquo;s take a look at the desktop.
A few common apps are pinned to the left taskbar.
Any application that is installed on a system is called a <strong>program</strong>.
One such program is the web browser <strong>Firefox</strong>
By clicking the Firefox icon, the <strong>program</strong> starts to run.
Any running program is called a <strong>process</strong>.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s test this by learning a new command.
With Firefox closed, run the command <code>ps</code>.
Use <code>man</code> to learn what it does.
If you use it as-is in the terminal, it displays two running processes: <code>bash</code> and <code>ps</code> itself:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
   1929 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
   3304 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
</code></pre><ul><li><code>bash</code> stands for <em>Bourne-Again Shell</em> and is the command interpreter used by the terminal.
In other words, it&rsquo;s what reads your input and executes the commands you type.</li><li>You already know what <code>ps</code> is.
But why is it here? You see, in order for <code>ps</code> to start scanning for what processes are running, it needs to be running itself, which means it&rsquo;s inevitable that it finds itself while scanning.</li></ul><p>Now open Firefox from the side bar and run <code>ps</code> again:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
   1929 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
   3304 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
</code></pre><p>Where is Firefox?
Well, when run without parameters, <code>ps</code> displays the processes that are running <strong>inside the current terminal</strong>, i.e. that have been started from this terminal.
Firefox was started from the GUI, so it has nothing to do with our terminal.
Use <code>man</code> to learn how to list the <strong>full</strong> output of <strong>all</strong> processes in the system.</p><p>Hopefully you haven&rsquo;t cheated and did find the <code>-A</code> (or <code>-e</code>) and <code>-f</code> options yourself.
Now the output is rather huge, but we only care about the final lines:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# ps -A -f
[...]
root        3367    1612 50 15:54 ?        00:00:01 /usr/lib/firefox-esr/firefox-esr

root        3623    1929  0 15:54 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -A -f
</code></pre><p>Great success!
We have seen Firefox move from being a simple program to being a running process.
In addition, we&rsquo;ve learned a new command that is useful for inspecting what processes might be running on a system.
Once you hack into a remote system, you can use <code>ps</code> to inspect what potentially exploitable processes are there.</p><h3 id=scripts>Scripts</h3><p>It is often convenient to group together a set of instrucitons so that you don&rsquo;t have to type them separately each time you want to make use of their combined functionality.
For this purpose, you can use Bash scripts.
They are text files that simply contain Bash commands.
Bash is also a programming lanugage that comes with <code>if</code> statements, <code>for</code> loops, functions and more, but we won&rsquo;t be needing those right now.</p><p>Bash scripts typically bear the extension <code>.sh</code>, but this is by no means mandatory.
Take some time to take a look at and run the Bash script in <code>activities/demo-bash/demo.sh</code>.
You can run it like so:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~/essentials/welcome-to-linux/activities/demo-bash# sh demo.sh
</code></pre><h2 id=enter-python>Enter Python</h2><h3 id=the-basics>The Basics</h3><p>Python is a programming language designed with simplicty in mind.
It&rsquo;s meant to be simple and fast to read, understand and write.
This is evident even from the language&rsquo;s syntax.</p><p>To get accustomed to Python, take a look at the code in the <code>activities/demo-python</code> dierctory.
Feel free to fiddle with any of the code snippets.
Add your own, try things out and experiment!</p><p>In order to run a Python script, just type the name of the script preceeded by <code>python3</code>:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~/essentials/welcome-to-linux/activities/demo-python# python3 variables.py
</code></pre><h4 id=variables>Variables</h4><p>Let&rsquo;s start with <a href=./activities/demo-python/variables.py>variables.py</a>.
This file explains how variables such as integers, floats and strings work in Python.
It also introduces the <code>print</code> function.
Inspect and run the code.
Note that, unlike C code, in Python there is no need for a <code>;</code> at the end of each line.</p><h4 id=if-statements>If Statements</h4><p>Now that we know how to create and print variables, let&rsquo;s learn some more of the language&rsquo;s syntax, starting with the <code>if</code> keyword.
A typical <code>if</code> statement looks like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=color:#204a87;font-weight:700>if</span> <span style=color:#000>condition</span><span style=color:#000;font-weight:700>:</span>
    <span style=color:#8f5902;font-style:italic># run some code</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Notice that there are no <code>{}</code>, like you would use in C.
This is because Python relies on <strong>indentation</strong> to determine which instructions make up the body of the <code>if</code> statement and which don&rsquo;t.
Moreover, a colon (<code>:</code>) needs to be used after every <code>if</code>, <code>for</code> or function declaration, as we&rsquo;ll see shortly.
To make things clearer, check out and run the code in <code>activities/demo-python/if.py</code>.</p><p>As stated above, this code would not work because the <code>print</code> instruction is not correctly indented and the <code>if</code> statement appears to have no body:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=color:#204a87;font-weight:700>if</span> <span style=color:#000>a</span> <span style=color:#ce5c00;font-weight:700>==</span> <span style=color:#0000cf;font-weight:700>0</span><span style=color:#000;font-weight:700>:</span>

This means that <strong>each key</strong> is associated to <strong>one value</strong>.
The opposite does not always hold true.
Thus, each <strong>key</strong> in a dictionary is unique, but there is no such rule for <strong>values</strong>.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s construct a dictionary and see what it does:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=color:#000>my_dict</span> <span style=color:#ce5c00;font-weight:700>=</span> <span style=color:#000;font-weight:700>{</span>

Run it, and then check the contents of the <code>output.txt</code> file it creates.</p><h4 id=strings-or-bytes>Strings or Bytes?</h4><p>In the previous section, we saw how we can read <strong>strings</strong> from and write them to files.
However, the more frequent way of interacting with files is by using <strong>byte arrays</strong>.</p><p><strong>Byte arrays</strong> are very similar to strings, supporting nearly the same operations, but differ in representation.
While strings can also encode non-ASCII characters, such as <code>ä</code>, or even emoji, bytes are restricted to ASCII characters.
For this reason, one letter in a byte array is exactly one byte in size, whereas a letter in a string could use more space, depending on its encoding.
As a result, the main reason they exist is to process data, regardless of encoding.
Network packet data, binary file contents, images are all to be processed as bytes, not as strings.</p><p>You can create a byte array just like you would create a regular string <strong>and adding a <code>b</code> in front</strong>, like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=color:#000>my_bytes</span> <span style=color:#ce5c00;font-weight:700>=</span> <span style=color:#4e9a06>b</span><span style=color:#4e9a06>&#39;SSS Rulz, but in bytes!&#39;</span>

It is capable of instantly displaying an entire file hierarchy.</p><p>But sometimes we have to deal with a large hierarchy in which we know what we&rsquo;re looking for.</p><p>As an example, let&rsquo;s look for the <code>memc.h</code> header file of the Linux kernel.
It&rsquo;s a small file that defines a tiny part of the communication between the GPU and RAM.
The header files corresponding to the version of your kernel are located in <code>/usr/src/linux-headers-5.6.0-kali2-common</code>.
Now go look for <code>memc.h</code>.
Good luck!
You should find it by&mldr; <em>tomorrow</em>.</p><p>But don&rsquo;t look for it manually.
This would be stupid.
You know what the name of the file is and you know the folder where to <strong>find</strong> it.
That&rsquo;s a lot of information already.
There is a Linux command that&rsquo;s useful for looking for files with certain particularities (such as names, size, access rights etc.) in a file hierarchy.
Which is exactly what we need!
This command is called <code>find</code>.
It outputs all files in a directory (and its subdirectories) that match some given properties.
Look up its syntax in the <code>man</code> page.
Look for the string &ldquo;EXAMPLES&rdquo;.
It should lead you to a section at the end of the <code>man</code> page, which gives you a series of detailed examples of the command&rsquo;s usage.</p><p>From them and from the commands general description at the beginning of the <code>man</code> page, we can see that <code>find</code> is generally used like this:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# find &lt;where to look&gt; &lt;what to look for&gt;
</code></pre><ul><li><code>&lt;where to look></code> is quite self-explanatory: it&rsquo;s a path in the file system, from where <code>find</code> will start to look for what whe told it.
This means that <code>find</code> traverse the file system <em>down</em> from the path it&rsquo;s given by looking exhaustively into each of its directories.</li><li><code>&lt;what to look for></code> is where things get more intersting.
We&rsquo;ve already said that we can look for files that match certain properties, such as names, permissions, sizes, types and so on.
Each of these properties can be specified as follows:</li></ul><p><code>find</code> can take many more parameters, as described below.</p><h4 id=type><code>type</code></h4><p>This parameter allows us to select either regular files (<code>-type f</code>), or directories (<code>-type d</code>) and so on.
Here&rsquo;s an example:</p><pre><code>$ find /some/random/path -type d
</code></pre><p>This command will list all subdirectories in <code>/some/random/path</code>.</p><h4 id=size><code>size</code></h4><p>Filters files by size.
For example, we can look for all files whose sizes are 100 bytes using this command</p><pre><code>$ find /some/random/path -size 100c
</code></pre><p>The <code>c</code> at the end specifies that we&rsquo;re using bytes as unit of measurement.
The size can also be specified in:</p><ul><li><strong>kibibytes</strong> (1024 bytes) using the letter <code>k</code>;</li><li><strong>mebibytes</strong> (1024 kibibytes) using the letter <code>M</code>;</li><li><strong>gibibytes</strong> (1024 mebibytes) using the letter <code>G</code>;</li></ul><p>But looking for files with <strong>exactly</strong> a given size seldom happens.
It is more often the case that we&rsquo;re looking for files <em>smaller</em> or <em>larger</em> than some value.
For this reason, we may use the <code>-</code> (smaller) or <code>+</code> signs before the actual size, like this:</p><pre><code>$ find /some/random/path -size +100k  # Find all files with a size larger than 100kB.
</code></pre><h4 id=name><code>name</code></h4><p>This is the simplest property.
It&rsquo;s for when you&rsquo;re looking for a file with a certain name.
For finding the file <code>my_file</code>, it goes like this:</p><pre><code>find /some/random/path -name my_file
</code></pre><p>This parameter is the one we need for our current task.
In order to find the file <code>memc.h</code>, we&rsquo;ll run:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# find /usr/src/linux-headers-5.6.0-kali2-common/ -name memc.h
/usr/src/linux-headers-5.6.0-kali2-common/arch/arm/include/asm/hardware/memc.h
root@kali:~# cat /usr/src/linux-headers-5.6.0-kali2-common/arch/arm/include/asm/hardware/memc.h
/* SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-only */
[...]
#endif
</code></pre><h3 id=globbing>Globbing</h3><p>But what if we only knew a portion of our filename?
Or what if we intentionally wanted to find all files ending in <code>.log</code>, for instance?</p><p>For this, we need to use the concept of <strong>globbing</strong>.
This mechanism defines a set of special characters that are interpreted differently than regular ASCII text.</p><h4 id=-0-or-more-characters><code>*</code>: 0 or more characters</h4><p>The <code>*</code> character is interpreted as any number of characters of any type.
Basically, <code>*</code> stands for everything and nothing.
Take a look at the example below:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# ls D*
Desktop:

Documents:

Downloads:
</code></pre><p>The <code>*</code> makes <code>ls</code>&rsquo;s parameter <strong>match</strong> any file name that starts with <code>D</code>.
You can use <code>*</code> anywhere in your parameter.
Moreover, any command that takes a file name as input accepts the globbing syntax.
Here&rsquo;s another example:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# find /usr/src/linux-headers-5.6.0-kali2-common -name *group*  # List all linux kernel header files whose names contain the word &quot;group&quot;

</code></pre><p>The most commonly used globbing examples (apart from <code>*</code>) are listed below.</p><h4 id=-one-or-more-characters><code>+</code>: one or more characters</h4><p>This symbol is very similar to <code>*</code>.
However, <code>+</code> needs at least one character in order to match the specific string.</p><h4 id=ranges>Ranges</h4><p><code>[]</code> represents a <em>range</em>.
Let&rsquo;s look at the following range: <code>[a-f]</code>.
It starts at <code>a</code> and ends with <code>f</code>, inclusively.
<code>[0-9]</code>, for example, matches any digit.
Likewise, <code>[A-Z]</code> matches any capital leter, and so on.</p><p>You can combine ranges.
For instance, <code>[a-zA-Z]</code> matches any letter.</p><h4 id=sets>Sets</h4><p>In order to represent a set of characters to be matched, <code>{}</code> are used.
<code>{a,0,m,b}</code> matches <em>either</em> <code>a</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>m</code> or <code>b</code>.</p><h4 id=escaping>Escaping</h4><p>What if we want to match the <code>*</code> character itself?
Or any of the special characters above, such as <code>+</code>, <code>[</code>, <code>]</code>, <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>?
Obviously, we can match <strong>any</strong> character.
The special characters can be matched by <strong>escaping</strong> them.</p><p>Escaping is the practice of specifying that a symbol be interpreted as a regular character and not as part of a globbing expression.
This feature is achieved by placing a <code>\</code> character before any special globbing character that you want to escape.
Here are a few examples:</p><ul><li><code>\*</code>: matches a literal <code>*</code>;</li><li><code>\[</code>: matches a literal <code>[</code>;</li><li><code>{\+,\}}</code>: matches either a literal <code>+</code>, or a literal <code>}</code>.</li></ul><p>You can <strong>combine</strong> escaped characters and globbing expressions as you please.</p><h3 id=redirecting-streams>Redirecting Streams</h3><p>Any process (remember that Linux commands are processes, too) uses 3 implicit data streams.</p><h4 id=standard-input-stdin>Standard Input (<code>stdin</code>)</h4><p>This is the &ldquo;place&rdquo; from where the process reads its data.
Many processes read data from the keyboard:</p><ul><li><code>man</code>&rsquo;s <code>stdin</code> is the keyboard because it reads user commands and interprets them in order to navigate the current <code>man</code> page.</li><li><code>bash</code>&rsquo;s <code>stdin</code> is also the keyboard.
<code>bash</code> reads user input, that is typed into the terminal and then executes those commands.</li></ul><p>The main alternative to getting input from the terminal is using a file.
Strictly from a teaching standpoint, unless given a file, <code>cat</code> reads its input from the terminal (kinda useless, we know).
Let&rsquo;s showcase the usage of <code>stdin</code> redirection.
First, let&rsquo;s use <code>cat</code> without redirection.</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# cat  # Read input from the terminal.
SSS Rulz!
SSS Rulz!
^C
root@kali:~# # We used Ctrl + C to close the above cat process.
</code></pre><p>Now let&rsquo;s redirect <code>cat</code>&rsquo;s input to a file.
We use <code>&lt;</code> in order to redirect <code>stdin</code>.</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# cat &lt; essentials/README.md 
# Security Summer School: Security Essentials Track
[...]
</code></pre><p>Let&rsquo;s look more closely at what happens here, as opposed to running <code>cat essentials/README.md</code>:</p><ul><li><code>cat essentials/README.md</code> makes the <code>cat</code> command itself open the <code>essentials/README.md</code> file and read bytes from it;</li><li><code>cat &lt; essentials/README.md</code> has <strong>the underlying <code>bash</code> process</strong> read the <code>essentials/README.md</code> file and <strong>feed its content</strong> to <code>cat</code>, which is now reading input <strong>from the underlying <code>bash</code> process</strong>.</li></ul><p>The same output is printed, but the mechanism now differs entirely.</p><h4 id=standard-output-stdout>Standard Output (<code>stdout</code>)</h4><p><code>stdout</code> is the complement of <code>stdin</code>.
A processes output is generally displayed to <code>stdout</code>.
Generally, this stream is also the terminal.
We&rsquo;ve already seen this feature when running almost any command so far.</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# ls
Desktop    essentials           Music     Public         Videos

</code></pre><p>We&rsquo;ve seen this output may times in the previous session.
The names of the directories and files inside the current folder are printed <strong>to <code>stdout</code></strong>, i.e. to the terminal.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s redirect <code>ls</code>&rsquo;s output to a file:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# ls &gt; ls_output
</code></pre><p>Notice that now there is <em>seemingly</em> no output.
In reality, it does exist, but is written by <code>ls</code> to the <code>ls_output</code> file instead of the standard <code>stdout</code> stream (the terminal).</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# cat ls_output  # The same files as before. Their layout changes, though.

</code></pre><h4 id=standard-error-stderr>Standard Error (<code>stderr</code>)</h4><p>Sometimes commands fail.
If you haven&rsquo;t encountered one, you haven&rsquo;t been using Linux for long enough.
Here&rsquo;s a simple error:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# ls whatever
ls: cannot access 'whatever': No such file or directory
</code></pre><p>The error message (<code>ls: cannot access 'whatever': No such file or directory</code>) is displayed to the terminal, so it would make sense for it to be printed by <code>ls</code> to <code>stdout</code>, right?
Well&mldr; no.
It&rsquo;s printed to another stream, called <code>stderr</code>.
As its name implies, this stream is dedicated to error messages.
This distinction was made in order for users to be able to separate between useful / legitimate output and sometimes unimportant error messages.</p><p>Redirecting <code>stderr</code> is performed using 2 characters: <code>2></code>.</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# ls whatever 2&gt; ls_error
root@kali:~# # No error message. The error itself still did happen.
root@kali:~# cat ls_error  # I told you so...
ls: cannot access 'whatever': No such file or directory
</code></pre><h4 id=appending>Appending</h4><p>Let&rsquo;s redirect <code>ls</code>&rsquo;s output multiple times:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# ls essentials &gt; out

</code></pre><p>As you can see, when the second <code>ls</code> output is written to the <code>out</code> file, the first output is <strong>overwritten</strong>.
This sucks in case we want to generate large output files, such as logs.</p><p>But fear not!
Instead, remember last session&rsquo;s Python crash course.
More specifically, remember <code>open</code>&rsquo;s parameters.
The second one was <code>mode</code> and one of the modes is <em>append</em>, symbolised by the <code>a</code> character.
This mode makes any text that&rsquo;s written to that specific file to be added at the end of whatever data was already inside it, without overwriting anything.</p><p>We need something similar to that, which can be achieved by using <code>>></code> for redirecting <code>stdin</code> and <code>2>></code> for redirecting <code>stderr</code>.
Here&rsquo;s how it works for the previous <code>ls</code> commands:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# ls essentials &gt; out  # This command also creates the out file. It is irrelevant whether we use &gt; or &gt;&gt;.

</code></pre><p>Lovely!</p><h4 id=pipes>Pipes</h4><p>Up to now, we&rsquo;ve looked at how to redirect the basic streams of a process to files.
But what if we wanted to redirect <strong>one stream of a process into the stream of another process</strong>?
Of course we can do this, too, by using the <strong>pipe</strong> (<code>|</code>).</p><p>To demonstrate the usage of pipes, we&rsquo;ll introduces the <code>tac</code> command.
Notice it&rsquo;s <code>cat</code> in reverse.
This is not arbitrary.
If <code>cat</code> displays the <strong>lines</strong> in a file <strong>in order</strong>, <code>tac</code> does the same, but <strong>in reverse order</strong>.
Let&rsquo;s exemplify using the global <code>README.md</code>:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# tac essentials/README.md

Welcome to the Security Essentials Track of the Security Summer School.

# Security Summer School: Security Essentials Track
</code></pre><p>Now let&rsquo;s actually use a pipe.
We&rsquo;ll also use a command from before, so we keep things simple.
Let&rsquo;s find all Linux kernel header files whose names contain the word &ldquo;group&rdquo; and then print them <strong>in reverse order</strong>:</p><pre><code>find /usr/src/linux-headers-5.6.0-kali2-common -name *group* | tac
</code></pre><p>Notice this output is the one you saw in section <a href=#-0-or-more-characters><code>*</code>: 0 or more characters</a>, but in reverse.</p><h4 id=xargs><code>xargs</code></h4><p>We&rsquo;ve seen how powerful pipes are.
Remember that pipes redirect the <code>stdout</code> of the first command into the second&rsquo;s <code>stdin</code>.
But what if we wanted to redirect the same <code>stdout</code> as command line parameters for the second command?</p><p>This is when we would use <code>| xargs</code>.
Let&rsquo;s assume this hypothetical command:</p><pre><code>$ cmd1 | xargs cmd2
</code></pre><p>where <code>cmd1</code> and <code>cmd2</code> are hypothetical commands.
The <code>| xargs</code> keyword makes <strong>every line</strong> from the <code>stdout</code> of <code>cmd1</code> be passed <strong>as a separate parameter</strong> to <code>cmd2</code>.</p><p>A very powerful use case of <code>xargs</code> is <code>find ... | xargs grep ...</code>.
Such commands allow us to look for strings in all files that match certain criteria <strong>at once</strong>.
Let&rsquo;s showcase this by inspecting all log files about the <code>systemd</code> process:</p><pre><code># find /var/log -type f -name *log | xargs grep systemd
</code></pre><h3 id=less-is-more>Less is More</h3><p>Try running the following command:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# tree -L 2 /
</code></pre><p>You can see that its output is rather huge.
For large directory hierarchies, <code>tree</code>&rsquo;s output can be overwhelming.
The same thing can happen when running <code>find</code> commands.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve already seen how we can trim such outputs down by <code>grep</code>ping them, but sometimes we have no criterion on which to do so.
In these situations, we have no alternative but to look at the entire output.
In order to do so in more easily, we can use the <code>less</code> command.</p><p>First of all, <code>less</code> can be used just like you would use <code>cat</code>.
Run the commands below.
You can navigate inside <code>less</code> the same way you can navigate inside <code>man</code>.
<strong>And you definitely remember how to navigate inside <code>man</code>!!!</strong></p><pre><code>root@kali:~# cat /var/log/syslog  # Never ending logs...
[...]
root@kali:~# less /var/log/syslog  # Much better.
</code></pre><p>Inside <code>less</code>, try searching for the string &ldquo;network&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong> Don&rsquo;t scroll your terminal.
It doesn&rsquo;t look cool.
Use <code>less</code>!</p><h3 id=grep>Grep</h3><p><code>find</code> has taught us how to use various criteria in order to filter throigh a file hierarhcy.
This is definitely useful, but we can do better.
<code>find</code> is highly capable of filtering output based on the files' <strong>metadata</strong>, i.e. &ldquo;surface level&rdquo; information, such as sizes, names and so on.</p><p>It would be really useful if we had a means to filter files <strong>based on their content</strong>.
And we do!
This tool is called <code>grep</code>.
<code>grep</code> is capable of matching strings based on the contents of files, not just on their names.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look for the &ldquo;stdin&rdquo; string in this README:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# grep &quot;stdin&quot; essentials/system-exploration/README.md
#### Standard Input (`stdin`)
- `man`'s `stdin` is the keyboard because it reads user commands and interprets them in order to navigate the current `man` page.
- `bash`'s `stdin` is also the keyboard.
Let's showcase the usage of `stdin` redirection.
We use `&lt;` in order to redirect `stdin`.
`stdout` is the complement of `stdin`.
We need something similar to that, which can be achieved by using `&gt;&gt;` for redirecting `stdin` and `2&gt;&gt;` for redirecting `stderr`.
</code></pre><p>As you can see, <code>grep</code> outputs the <strong>lines that contain the given string</strong>.
This makes <code>grep</code> extremely useful for looking for CTF flags.
We simply need to <code>grep "SSS"</code>.</p><h4 id=grep-a-file-hierarchy>Grep a File Hierarchy</h4><p>At this point, you may be tempted to believe that we can only <code>grep</code> a single file.
Nope.
We can even <code>grep</code> strings in entire file hierarchies, which is extremely powerful.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s <code>grep</code> the <code>task_struct</code> symbol in our kernel&rsquo;s header files.
This symbol is a C <code>struct</code> that contains all the information associated with any Linux process.</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# grep -R &quot;task_struct&quot; /usr/src/linux-headers-5.6.0-kali2-common | less  # The output is rather large, so we contain it with less.
</code></pre><p><strong>Remember this distinction:</strong> <code>find</code> looks for file <strong>metadata</strong> (names, permissions, size, type), while <code>grep</code> looks for file <strong>data</strong>.</p><h2 id=inspecting-files>Inspecting Files</h2><p>Now that we can find our way inside a file hierarchy, we need a means by which to inspect those files.
<code>grep</code> works just fine, provided we&rsquo;re dealing with text files.
But what if we aren&rsquo;t?</p><p>In this case, we&rsquo;ll need to taka a sneak peak into some <em>binary analysis</em>.
We&rsquo;ll get back to this subject starting from from Session <a href=../data-representation>Data Representation</a>.</p><h3 id=file><code>file</code></h3><p>First, we want to get some more detailed information about what type of binary file we are dealing with specifically.
<code>ls</code> already gives us information such as the file&rsquo;s name, size and permissions.
This is all fine, but this information is common to all files. Whether we&rsquo;re dealing with an image, or with an executable file <code>ls</code> won&rsquo;t tell us.</p><p>But <code>file</code> does.
<code>file</code> works by reading a file&rsquo;s header (the first few bytes at the beginning of the file, which hold information about its format and type).
Thus, it is capable of outputting more precise information than <code>ls</code>.
Let&rsquo;s test it using one of today&rsquo;s challenges, <code>activities/05-challenge_not-your-doge/public/not-doge.pnm</code>.</p><pre><code>root@kali:~/essentials/system-exploration# file activities/05-challenge_not-your-doge/public/not-doge.pnm
activities/05-challenge_not-your-doge/public/not-doge.pnm: Netpbm image data, size = 500 x 590, rawbits, pixmap
</code></pre><h3 id=strings><code>strings</code></h3><p>One of the most basic forms of binary analysis is to simply look for any human-readable string present in a binary file.
For this purpose, we&rsquo;ll use the <code>strings</code> command.</p><h4 id=tutorial-doge>Tutorial: Doge</h4><p>The best way to showcase the <code>strings</code> command is to use it in order to find our first flag for today.
Head to the <code>activities/doge/public</code> folder and take a look at the image you&rsquo;ve been given.</p><p>Since this section is dedicated to the <code>strings</code> command, we&rsquo;ll run this command on our <code>doge.jpg</code> file:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~/essentials/system-exploration/activities/doge/public# strings doge.jpg
JFIF
[...]
eP!_&quot;
</code></pre><p>So there are lots of human-readable strings in this image, but very few, if any, actually make any sense.
In order to filter them out, we&rsquo;ll use what we&rsquo;ve learned today: <code>|</code> + <code>grep</code>.
We&rsquo;ll try to find the flag itself.
Maybe we get lucky.</p><pre><code>root@kali:~/essentials/system-exploration/activities/doge/public# strings doge.jpg | grep SSS
&lt;there should be a flag here&gt;
</code></pre><p>That&rsquo;s how you use <code>strings</code>: often in combination with some filtering mechanism, such as <code>grep</code>.</p><p>Another way to get the flag is to run the <code>file</code> command:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~/essentials/system-exploration# file activities/doge/public/doge.jpg 
activities/doge/public/doge.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, aspect ratio, density 1x1, segment length 16, comment: &quot;SSS{grep_your_strings}&quot;, progressive, precision 8, 500x500, components 3
</code></pre><p>The flag is included in the file as a comment.
Image comments are often used in CTFs in order to hide some more subtle information, such as hints.
Always remember to check them out.</p><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>Here are a few useful snippets from today&rsquo;s session:</p><ul><li><code>grep -R "some string" /some/path</code>: recursively looks for &ldquo;some string&rdquo; inside all the files in the <code>some/path</code> directory;</li><li><code>find /some/path -name *flag* -type f</code>: recursively searches for regular files in the <code>/some/path</code> directory, whose names include the word <code>flag</code>;</li><li><code>cat large_file | grep SSS</code>: looks for the <code>SSS</code> string in a large file, so you don&rsquo;t have to do this manually;</li><li><code>find some/path &lt;some criteria> | xargs grep SSS</code>: look for the <code>SSS</code> string in each file that matches some specified criteria.</li></ul><h2 id=activities>Activities</h2><h3 id=challenge-surgical-precision>Challenge: Surgical Precision</h3><p>There are many false flags out there.

But it&rsquo;s incomplete.
Find a way to reveal it completely.</p><h2 id=further-reading>Further Reading</h2><h2 id=forensics>Forensics</h2><p>The greater CTF topic of today has been <strong>forensics</strong>.
It&rsquo;s probably one of the vastest and most diverse topics out there, because it doesn&rsquo;t really fit into many patterns.
You can read more about forensics <a href=https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/forensics/>here</a>.</p><h3 id=regular-expressions>Regular Expressions</h3><p>Regular expressions are like globs on steroids.
They provide a huge step-up in terms of expressiveness.
As expected, they&rsquo;re also more difficult to understand.</p><p>By default, <code>grep</code> actually matches regular expressions, not just raw strings.
<code>find</code> can also look fore files matching regular expressions, by using the <code>-regex</code> and <code>-regextype</code> parameters (yes, there are multiple regex syntaxes).</p><p>A good point from which to start learning how to use regular expressions are these resources:</p><ul><li><a href=https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285>https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285</a></li><li><a href=https://regexone.com/>https://regexone.com/</a></li></ul><p>For testing your regular expressions before using them, <a href=https://regex101.com/>this website</a> is king.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve got the hang of regular expressions, test your skills in the <a href=https://regexcrossword.com/>Regex Crossword</a>.
Yes, such a thing really does exist and it&rsquo;s as crazy as you might think.
Give it a try!</p><p>Moreover, most programming languages have libraries for regular expressions.
Python can do so, too.
Take a look at its <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html>regex module</a>.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-ac5929dc458b67464d6e9132d5c41a8a>3 -</h1><h1 id=explaining-the-internet>Explaining the Internet</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>In this session, we&rsquo;ll discuss some networking fundamentals.

and <a href=../hacking-the-web>Hacking the Web</a>.</p><p>Moreover, we&rsquo;ll explain what happens when you access a URL (we&rsquo;ll also learn how to do this from our terminals).
Last but not least, we&rsquo;ll see what those <code>ssh</code> commands you&rsquo;ve been using in order to solve the remote challenges mean.</p><h2 id=reminders-and-prerequisites>Reminders and Prerequisites</h2><p>For this session, you&rsquo;ll need:</p><ul><li>a working internet connection;</li><li>a Linux environment that you&rsquo;re comfortable working with;</li><li>to understand what a <em>process</em> is;</li><li>general knowledge of the Linux CLI, as discussed in session <a href=../welcome-to-linux>Welcome to Linux</a>.</li></ul><h2 id=a-general-overview-of-the-internet>A General Overview of the Internet</h2><p>Before learning how to use and, later, how to hack the Internet, let&rsquo;s first understand its building blocks.
The Internet is all about sending data to and from an enormous amount of hosts.</p><p>In order to learn how all of this works, let&rsquo;s start from the example below.
It&rsquo;s generic enough for it to be relatable to most networking scenarios.
Yet, it encompasses everything we need to talk about.</p><p><img src=./assets/network_stack.png alt="Network Stack"></p><p>So what happens here is that the computer on the left is trying to <strong>send</strong> data to the one on the right.
We call the left computer <strong>the sender</strong> and the right one <strong>the receiver</strong>.
The two computers are connected via a <strong>medium</strong> on which the actual bits of data that make up the communication are sent.
In short, this medium is the connection between the aforementioned computers.</p><p>However, there are 4 boxes above the aforementioned medium.
These boxes are altogether known as <strong>The TCP/IP Network Stack</strong>.
We&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s with the <em>TCP/IP</em> part soon enough.
Individually, each box is a <strong>layer</strong>.
Here are the 4 layers of the TCP/IP stack:</p><p><img src=./assets/tcp_ip_network_stack.svg alt="The TCP/IP Network Stack"></p><p>Each layer provides a well-defined set of requirements, which are fulfilled by <strong>protocols</strong>.
A networking protocol is a set of rules that define the communication (data formatting and processing) between the same two levels of the network stack.
For example, there are protocols for the transport layer, others for the link layer and so on.
We&rsquo;ll talk about them in a bit.</p><h3 id=encapsulation>Encapsulation</h3><p>Each layer takes care of a specific requirement of networking, as we&rsquo;ll discuss shortly.
When sending data, each of the layers in the TCP/IP model accepts data from the layer above (or from the user in the case of the application layer), and adds additional information to the data that is necessary for that layer to carry out its task.
In some cases, the original data may be processed in some way before the additional information is added.
For example, it might be encrypted.
The layer then passes this data on to the layer below (or onto the transmission medium in the case of the link layer).</p><p>The arrival of data from an upper layer may trigger additional separate messages to be sent to the receiving end.
For instance, if the data needed to be encrypted, the layer that carries out the encryption has to exchange initial setup messages with the receiving end to agree the encryption method and other data that we&rsquo;ll touch on in the session <a href=../data-security>Data Security</a>, before the encrypted data can be transferred.</p><p>At the receiving end, the process happens in reverse: each layer accepts data from the layer below, inspects and removes the additional information added on by the corresponding layer in the sending end, before passing it up to the layer above.</p><p>Data is passed from a sender process to a receiver process by using the services of the layer below.
It is only the final layer that actually causes the data to be transmitted onto the transmission media (e.g. cable). Below is a representation of this whole mechanism.</p><p><img src=./assets/network_layers.png alt="General Workings of a Network Stack Layer"></p><p>This method of modular communication is called <strong>encapsulation</strong>.
It can be likened to taking the data from the layer above and placing it in an <strong>envelope</strong>, writing some additional information on the envelope, then passing the envelope to the layer below.
At the receiving end, a layer is passed an envelope from the layer below.
It looks at the data on the outside of the envelope to decide what to do with the contents of the envelope.
It then opens the envelope and passes the contained data up to the next level. The reverse of encapsulation is <strong>decapsulation</strong>.
After a message has passed through the network stack, it ends up in a <em>matrioshka</em> of envelopes, one for each layer, each with its own, specific information.</p><h3 id=a-bit-of-nomenclature>A Bit of Nomenclature</h3><p>As we said previously, each of the layers of the TCP/IP model adds its own information to the data coming from the layer above.
This encapsulation at each layer results in a new structure effectively wrapping up the original data.
Each of these has a specific name depending on the layer that creates it:</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>TCP/IP Layer</th><th style=text-align:center>Name of data block produced by the layer</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center>Application</td><td style=text-align:center>Application data (e.g. HTTP, HTTPS)</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Transport</td><td style=text-align:center>Segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP)</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Internet</td><td style=text-align:center>Packets (e.g IP packet)</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Link</td><td style=text-align:center>Frames (e.g. Ethernet frame)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=the-medium>The Medium</h2><p>This layer is not mentioned in the above diagrams, but is worth talking a little bit about.
The medium represents the connection itself between the 2 stations.
This connection can be:</p><ul><li><strong>wired</strong>: using a cable on which digital signals that encode the bits are sent</li><li><strong>wireless</strong>: using high-frequency radio waves in order to send the same signals as before</li></ul><h2 id=the-link-layer>The Link Layer</h2><p>This layer is also known as the <strong>Data Link</strong> layer.</p><p>It represents the underlying technology of any application.
The device on which the application is running may have a choice of many technologies to connect to a network, such as Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, 4G, 5G (<em>tinfoil hat off</em>) etc.
Where more than one link exists, the operating system of the device chooses the most appropriate link.
For instance, a mobile phone might be connected to both 4G and WiFi.
Most mobile phones prefer the WiFi connection, but remain connected to 4G mobile data, which they use as backup.
However, in some cases the application itself may dictate the choice of link, e.g. the mobile phone may decide to send traffic over WiFi to avoid 4G data charges.
Once the link has been chosen, the appropriate link layer protocol is selected.</p><p>The most commonly used link layer protocol is <strong>Ethernet</strong>.
Wired or wireless Ethernet is used on most local area networks (LANs).
The packets from the internet layer are further encapsulated in Ethernet frames which are designed to be transported across a local network.</p><p>This layer needs a means to identify local stations.
This is where the <strong>Media Access Control (MAC) addresses</strong> come in.
They are 48 bits long and are unique to a specific <strong>Network Interface Card (NIC)</strong>.
The MAC address is physically tied to the hardware of the computer, which means it may also be referred to as the hardware or physical address.</p><h2 id=the-internet-layer>The Internet Layer</h2><p>So each NIC has its own 48-bit MAC address.
This means there are <code>2^48</code> unique MACs, which means <code>2^48</code> unique NICs.
<code>2^48</code> is a huge number, which is way beyond everything humanity has produced so far.
So, since we aren&rsquo;t likely to run out of MAC addresses any time soon, a host can be easily identified in the Internet via its MAC, right?
Yes, it can.</p><p>There is one problem, though.
Suppose the sender is in the US and the receiver is in India.
There&rsquo;s no way you can connect these two hosts using the same medium.
You need some intermediaries: <strong>routers</strong>.</p><h3 id=routers>Routers</h3><p>It is impossible to connect your PC / laptop directly (physically) to every PC or server in the world.
Therefore, we need <strong>networks</strong>, which are basically aggregations of hosts (servers, PCs, laptops, mobile phones etc.).</p><p>Each network contains one <strong>router</strong> which sends data between the hosts in its network and those on other networks.
So a router is a networking device that connects two or more networks.
Think of the router you most probably have at home.
There is a <em>local network</em>, to which you can connect via WiFi, or Ethernet cables.
You&rsquo;re probably doing this right now.
Another network is the one provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).</p><p>There are many ISPs around the world and even more local home networks.
The web thus becomes a <em>web of routers</em> who transmit <strong>packets</strong> from one network to another.
Back to our example above, you will surely need many routers to get a packet from the US to India.</p><p>But how does a router know how where to send a packet?
Let&rsquo;s say a router R1 connects a laptop with IP 192.168.100.5 and a PC with IP 192.168.100.10 to the external network, as shown in the image below.</p><p><img src=./assets/router_in_action.svg alt="Router in Action"></p><p>Now let&rsquo;s look at 2 different scenarios:</p><ol><li>If the laptop sends a packet to IP <code>192.168.100.10</code>, the router knows this address is part of its <strong>Local Area Network (LAN)</strong> and sends it directly to the PC.</li><li>If the PC sends a packet to <code>upb.ro</code> (with IP <code>141.85.220.33</code>), the router sees its IP as an external address. Therefore, it passes it into the internet, where other routers take it and then pass it again to other routers and so on, until the packet reaches <code>upb.ro</code>.</li></ol><p>Each new router that a packet encounters on its way from source to destination is called a <strong>hop</strong>.
Most often, a hop is a router.
In order to visualise the hops that our requests to a well-known service, such as <code>google.com</code>, we use the <code>traceroute</code> command:</p><pre><code>┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]

</code></pre><p>Let&rsquo;s explain the output.
Each line represents a <strong>hop</strong> (i.e. a router) that a packet must pass through in order to reach <code>google.com</code>.
The first number is the index of the hop.
The second is the <em>IP</em> of the network.
You&rsquo;ve probably heard about IPs before.
We&rsquo;ll demystify them in a bit.
<code>traceroute</code> sends 3 packets, for consistency.
It counts the time it takes from sending each of these packets to the moment the response reaches the sender.
This time is called <strong>Round Trip Time (RTT)</strong>.
As we said, <code>traceroute</code> sends and monitors 3 packets in order to display the consistency of the link to each hop.</p><p>The first hop is between the VM and the host.
The other is the router to which the host is connected.
From then on, it&rsquo;s the wild Internet itself.</p><h3 id=ip-addresses>IP Addresses</h3><p>IP addresses or, in short, <strong>IPs</strong>, are 32-bit (i.e. 4 bytes) numbers used to identify <strong>hosts</strong>.
IP stands for <strong>Internet Protocol</strong>, which is the most widely used internet layer protocol.
Notice the difference between IPs and MACs.
While MACs are associated with NICs, IPs are associated with hosts.
Another difference is that whereas a MAC is unique to and engraved into the NIC, a host can change its IP more easily.
We won&rsquo;t go into this in today&rsquo;s session, but you can read about one such mechanism called <a href=#dhcp>DHCP</a>.</p><p>Of course you are free to express an IP address however you like, but by far the most common representation is to write each of its 4 bytes individually, in the decimal base, separated by a dot (<code>.</code>).
You&rsquo;ve already seen IP&rsquo;s when connecting to the remote hosts during the previous sessions.
Some IPs are:</p><ul><li><code>8.8.8.8</code>: is the address of Google&rsquo;s Public DNS Service.
We&rsquo;ll explain what the DNS is in a future <a href=#the-domain-name-system>section</a>.</li><li><code>69.63.176.13</code>: is a common IP address used by Facebook</li><li><code>141.85.224.100</code>: is IP the address of one of the machines in our CTF infrastructure</li></ul><p>In order to see the IP of your machine, run the following command:</p><pre><code>┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]

</code></pre><p>Your output may differ slightly.</p><p>An IP address is associated with a <strong>network interface</strong>.
These interfaces can be virtual or physical (present on your NIC).
In your Kali VM, all interfaces are virtual.</p><p><strong><code>lo</code></strong> is the <strong>loopback</strong> interface.
It&rsquo;s an internal interface that each host possesses.
Its purpose is for testing the OS&rsquo;s TCP/IP stack.
Its IP is, by convention <code>127.0.0.1</code>, or <code>0.0.0.0</code>.</p><p><strong><code>eth0</code></strong> is the interface used to connect to the Internet.
It acts as a middleman between your host OS (the one in which you&rsquo;re running the VM) and the guest OS (Kali).
Its status is <em>UP</em> (i.e. it&rsquo;s running) and its IP address is <code>10.0.2.15</code>.</p><p>Notice the <code>/24</code> part.</p><h4 id=ping><code>ping</code></h4><p>In order to test whether a host is up or down, we can <code>ping</code> its IP.
<code>ping</code> sends packets to the given host (IP or website) and reports whether the host responds or not.
If it responds, it&rsquo;s obviously alive.
Otherwise&mldr; it&rsquo;s complicated.
It can either be dead itself, <strong>or there can be no route to it</strong>.
If we consider that the connection between us and our pinged host is <em>mediated</em> by a chain of routers, as shown in the image above, if <strong>one</strong> of those routers is down and doesn&rsquo;t transmit packets, then we may be unable to reach the pinged host.
So a better wording is to say that when a host doesn&rsquo;t respond to pings, it&rsquo;s not necessarily <em>down</em>, but merely <strong>unreachable</strong>.
From a host&rsquo;s point of view though, it&rsquo;s irrelevant whether a host is down for real or not.
An unreachable host is as good as a dead one: <em>useless</em>.</p><p><code>localhost</code>, in other words. the <code>lo</code> interface, should <strong>always</strong> be up and respond to pings.
In case it doesn&rsquo;t, well&mldr; your kernel&rsquo;s TCP/IP stack may be broken.
We use the <code>-c 3</code> parameter to only send 3 &ldquo;pings&rdquo; to <code>localhost</code>.
Otherwise, <code>ping</code> sends packets continuously, until stopped manually (with <code>ctrl + c</code>).</p><pre><code>┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]

Notice the very small times when pinging ourselves.
This makes sense, since there are no hops (routers) between a host and itself.</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s ping a remote server, say <code>google.com</code>.
We can <code>ping</code> either an IP or a URL.</p><pre><code>┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]

</code></pre><p>Now the RTTs are longer, because of the routing taking place between our VM and <code>google.com</code>.
The more routers on the way, the longer the RTT.</p><h3 id=urls>URLs</h3><p>In the above <code>ping</code> command, we used <code>google.com</code> instead of an IP.
But what exactly are strings such as <code>https://www.youtube.com</code> or <code>https://www.google.com</code>?</p><p><strong>Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)</strong> are exactly what their name implies: addresses to given resources on the Web.
This means that each URL can point to <em>at most</em> one resource (some URLs are invalid and, thus, point to no resources).
Such resources can be HTML pages, images, videos and many others.</p><p>Here are some examples of URLs:</p><ul><li><code>https://security-summer-school.github.io</code></li><li><code>https://github.com/security-summer-school/essentials/blob/master/explaining-the-internet/README.md</code></li><li><code>https://www.google.com/search?q=security+summer+school</code></li></ul><p>You&rsquo;ve probably figured out that these URLs look somewhat similar.
They all start with <code>https://</code>, they look like paths in the file system, separated by <code>/</code>, they use some special characters such as <code>?</code> and <code>+</code>.
In the next section, we&rsquo;ll explain all of these components.</p><h4 id=anatomy-of-a-url>Anatomy of a URL</h4><p>The image below summarises the building blocks of a URL</p><p><img src=./assets/url_anatomy.png alt="Anatomy of a URL"></p><p>Let&rsquo;s disect these components:</p><ul><li><strong>The scheme</strong> (sometimes called <em>schema</em>) indicates the application layer protocol that the browser must use to request the resource.
Usually, for websites, the protocol is HTTP (unsecured) or HTTPS (secured).
We&rsquo;ll get into the details of HTTP in the <a href=../rediscovering-the-browser>next session</a>.
Other schemes include <code>ftp</code> (File Transfer Protocol), <code>git</code>, <code>mailto</code> etc.</li><li><strong>The authority</strong> is separated from the scheme by the characters <code>://</code>
It includes both the domain (in our case: <code>www.example.com</code>) and the port (<code>80</code>), separated by a colon:<ul><li><strong>The domain</strong> indicates which Web server is being requested.
Usually this is a domain name, but an IP address may also be used (as you&rsquo;ve seen when solving our challenges).</li><li><strong>The port</strong> indicates the technical <em>gate</em> used to access the resources on the web server.
It is usually omitted if the web server uses the standard ports of the HTTP protocol (80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS) to grant access to its resources.
We&rsquo;ll explain this concept in further detail in the <a href=#the-transport-layer>Transport Layer</a> section.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The path</strong> to the resource was, in the early days of the Internet, a physical file location on the web server.
Nowadays, it is mostly an abstraction handled by web servers without any mandatory physical reality.</li><li><strong>The parameters</strong> are like function parameters, but they are passed to the web server itself.
Those parameters are a list of key - value pairs separated with the <code>&</code> symbol.
The web server can use those parameters to do extra stuff before returning the resource.
Each web server has its own rules regarding parameters.
Once again, we&rsquo;ll learn more about these parameters, more commonly known as <strong>query parameters</strong> in the <a href=../rediscovering-the-browser>next session</a>.</li><li><strong>The anchor</strong>, also known as <strong>fragment</strong>, is like a <em>bookmark</em> to some specific part of the resource.
It gives the browser directions to show the content located at that <em>bookmarked</em> spot.
On an HTML document, for example, the browser will scroll to the point where the anchor is defined; on a video or audio document, the browser will try to go to the time the anchor represents.
Markdown documents also use anchors, like so: <a href=https://github.com/security-summer-school/essentials/tree/master/explaining-the-internet#anatomy-of-a-url>https://github.com/security-summer-school/essentials/tree/master/explaining-the-internet#anatomy-of-a-url</a>.</li></ul><p>You might have heard the same things being called <em>Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)</em>.
This is correct, but it&rsquo;s not the most precise name you can use.
In order to understand the difference between URLs and URIs, check out their <a href=#url-vs-uri>corresponding section</a>.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll see how URLs are translated into IPs by a naming system called the <strong>Domanin Name System (DNS)</strong>.</p><h3 id=the-domain-name-system>The Domain Name System</h3><p>Remember: IPs, <strong>not URLs</strong>, are what&rsquo;s used to identify hosts (web servers included) on the Internet.
So there needs to be a service by which the URLs we&rsquo;ve just learned about are mapped to IPs.
This service is called the DNS.
It organises URLs in a hierarchical manner, in order to rapidly respond to queries.
You can think of the DNS as being similar to a <strong>phonebook of the Internet</strong>.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s how all of this works.
When you type <code>security-summer-school.github.io</code> into your browser, it sends a query over the Internet in order to find the website associated with the URL <code>security-summer-school.github.io</code>.
A query is a question asking to look up the domain name and respond to the corresponding IP address.
Let&rsquo;s follow the path of this question across the Internet.</p><p>In short, a DNS server performs the steps outlined <a href=https://howdns.works/ep1/>here</a>.</p><h4 id=the-recursive-resolver>The Recursive Resolver</h4><p>The first server that the query interacts with is what&rsquo;s called the <strong>recursive resolver</strong>.
This resolver is often operated by your ISP.
It is a database of other DNS servers, which asks it forwards the same question: &ldquo;What is the IP of <code>security-summer-school.github.io</code>?&rdquo;</p><h4 id=the-root-server>The Root Server</h4><p>The first DNS server that the recursive resolver talks to is the <strong>root server</strong>.
These servers are responsible for translating <em>top-level domains</em>, such as <code>.io</code>, <code>.com</code>, <code>.net</code> etc.
These root servers are few in number (only 13 across the world) and are highly secured.</p><h4 id=the-top-level-domain-name-server>The Top-Level Domain Name Server</h4><p>The next entity that processes the query is the <strong>Top-Level Domain (TLD) Name Server</strong>.
There are TLDs associated with each domain mentioned in the above section.
For instance, the search for <code>security-summer-school.github.io</code> will be passed to the TLD responsible for the <code>.io</code> domain.
This TLD will answer with <code>.io</code>&rsquo;s IP.</p><h4 id=the-authoritative-name-servers>The Authoritative Name Server(s)</h4><p>The last step in our lookup is <strong>The Authoritative Name Servers</strong> (sometimes the &ldquo;authoritative&rdquo; part is omitted).
We use the plural &ldquo;servers&rdquo; because our query may be for a subdomain.
In fact, our query for <code>security-summer-school.github</code> is one such case.
This means, that 2 name servers will fulfill the request.
The first server will fetch the IP of <code>.github.io</code> and the second will fetch the IP of the whole query (<code>security-summer-school.github.io</code>), by looking into the subdomains of <code>.github.io</code>.
This server is symilar to a dictionary, in which a specific domain name is translated into its IP.</p><h4 id=putting-it-together>Putting it Together</h4><p>As you&rsquo;ve probably noticed, the URLs are translated to IPs <em>in reverse order</em>.
As a result, <code>security-summer-school.github.io</code> is mapped to its IP in the order:</p><ul><li><code>.io</code>;</li><li><code>.github</code>;</li><li><code>security-summer-school</code>.</li></ul><p>This makes sense, as this order gradually narrows the <em>scope</em> in which the URL has to be searched.
It would be much more inefficient to look for <code>security-summer-school</code> across the whole Internet, rather than limiting the search to the <code>.github.io</code> domain.
The fact that we are able to perform queries in this manner is proof of the hierarchical nature of IP addresses.</p><p>All in all, the DNS lookup for <code>security-summer-school.github.io</code> is the one shown below.
Notice that the Recursive Resolver acts as a mediator between most of the DNS lookups.</p><p><img src=./assets/dns_lookup.png alt="DNS Lookup for security-summer-school.github.io"></p><p>Notice that only the domain of a URL has its name resolved to an IP address.
The port, path, parameters and anchor are handled by the web server itself.
The DNS part is, thus, necessary in order to <strong>find</strong> that web server.</p><h4 id=host><code>host</code></h4><p>In the previous section we explained the DNS.
Now let&rsquo;s put what we&rsquo;ve just learned into practice.
In order to query the DNS service, we use the <code>host</code> command.
It&rsquo;s pretty straightforward:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# host security.summer.schoo.github.io
security.summer.schoo.github.io has address 185.199.108.153
security.summer.schoo.github.io has address 185.199.110.153
security.summer.schoo.github.io has address 185.199.109.153
security.summer.schoo.github.io has address 185.199.111.153
security.summer.schoo.github.io has IPv6 address 2606:50c0:8002::153
security.summer.schoo.github.io has IPv6 address 2606:50c0:8000::153
security.summer.schoo.github.io has IPv6 address 2606:50c0:8003::153
security.summer.schoo.github.io has IPv6 address 2606:50c0:8001::153
</code></pre><p>Notice there are more IP&rsquo;s for <code>security.summer.schoo.github.io</code>.
The main reason for this is <strong>load balancing</strong>.
Github is accessed frequently and in order not to overload a single server, it uses multiple servers for a single domain.
Obviously, each of them serve the same web page: <code>security.summer.schoo.github.io</code>.
Github simply serves more machines to spread the workload.</p><h2 id=the-transport-layer>The Transport Layer</h2><p>So with IPs, we can connect two hosts however far apart they are.
So far, we managed to directly connect hosts.
Then we moved on to LANs and then to the whole Web.
This must be it, right?
We&rsquo;re now worldwide.
Why all the fuss about the Transport Layer.
Let&rsquo;s run an experiment: in your browser, open two tabs to your favourite website (which is <a href=https://security-summer-school.github.io>https://security-summer-school.github.io</a>, of course).
How are those connections handled?
How come what you do in one of the tabs does not interfere with what you do in the other?
IPs give us connections from host to host, but they can&rsquo;t differentiate between multiple connections between the same two hosts.</p><p>For this, we need another concept: <strong>ports</strong>.
The layer that implements these ports is called <strong>the transport layer</strong>.</p><p>The transport layer is the second layer of the protocol stack and sits immediately below the application layer.
At the transport layer there are two main protocols in use: <strong>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</strong> and <strong>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</strong>.
More about them in just a bit.</p><p>The transport layer accepts <strong>messages</strong> from the application layer as application data.
It does not care if this data is part of the connection setup process, actual data to be transferred, or some other control message.
It just sees the data as a bunch of bytes to be transported to the receiving end&rsquo;s transport layer.</p><h3 id=ports>Ports</h3><p>Generally speaking, ports are endpoints used for communication.
They have no physical correspondence, but are merely logical concepts used to segregate between different processes, all running on the same host.</p><p>A port is a 16-bit number used in order to identify multiple network-using processes <strong>on the same host</strong>.
Notice that with IPs we were talking about identifying <em>hosts</em> whereas now we&rsquo;ve increased the granularity and are talking about <em>processes</em>
As a result, when a sender process wants to connect to another process (the receiver), it must specify both the port it&rsquo;s currently using and the port used by the receiver.</p><p>Since ports are numbers up to <code>2^16</code>, this means there are 65536 of them.
This number is enough, given that it&rsquo;s meant to encompass the network-using processes in the system.
However, not all of them are available for your average network application.
The <strong>first 1024 (port numbers 0 to 1023)</strong> of them are reserved for common system applications and services.</p><h3 id=tcp>TCP</h3><p>The &ldquo;Control&rdquo; word in this protocol&rsquo;s name should give us a hint that TCP is about handling various errors that may occur while a packet is traversing the Internet.
For this reason, TCP keeps track of the amount of data it sends and ensures it arrives in order (by buffering any out-of-order packets).
This type of tracking is made possible by the use of <strong>sequence numbers (<code>Seq</code>)</strong>.
In addition, the receiver sends a special message whenever it gets a segment.
This message is called <strong>acknowledgement (ACK)</strong>.
Each ACK is sent together with an <strong>ACK number</strong>.
This number signifies the amount of bytes received so far by the host.
It is used by the sender to figure out what portion of the data to send as part of the next segment.</p><p><img src=./assets/tcp_ack_model.webp alt="TCP ACKs in Action"></p><p>In the above diagram we can see that the sender (client) adds some bytes (whose length is specified as <code>Len</code>) to those already sent.
At the same time, the receiver (server) adds the newly arrived bytes to those received previously and sends this number back to the client as the ACK number.</p><p>But some segments might arrive altered (some of their bits may be changed).
TCP adds what&rsquo;s called a <strong>checksum</strong> to each packet.
This checksum is computed by <code>xor</code>-ing all bytes in the segment.
When a segment is received, its checksum is recomputed and compared to the one contained within it.
If the two checksums differ, the receiver notifies the sender by sending a <strong>not ACK (NACK)</strong> segment instead of an ACK.
Upon receiving a NACK, the sender <strong>retransmits</strong> the segment.
The same mechanism is employed for segments that do not make it to the receiver.</p><p>In short, TCP makes sure that whatever is sent is received completely and correctly.
This feature is obviously important.
As a result, TCP is used for the transport-layer in the following application-level protocols and scenarios:</p><ul><li><strong>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</strong>, <strong>IMAP (Internet Access Message Protocol)</strong> and <strong>POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)</strong>: the main protocols used by email services worldwide.</li><li><strong>HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol / Secured)</strong>: the most popular protocol used to transfer web pages.
By default, HTTP uses port 80 and HTTPS uses port 443.</li><li><strong>SSH (Secure Shell)</strong>: a widely used protocol for obtaining a remote shell on another machine.</li></ul><h4 id=ssh>SSH</h4><p>We&rsquo;ve been using <code>ssh</code> to connect to the remote machines used for challenges and tutorials.
Now we know it is a protocol used for connecting to remote hosts via a shell.
It opens a TCP connection to the remote host, where each character typed in the terminal is sent to the receiving host.</p><p>As its name suggests, the gist of this protocol is <strong>secured</strong>.
The security implies that the characters are not sent to the receiver as plain text, but are <strong>encrypted</strong>.
While we&rsquo;ll discuss more about encryption in the <a href=../data-security>Data Security</a> session, it is important that we outline the main workings of encryption.</p><p>Upon initiating the SSH connection, an encryption algorithm is negociated between the communicating hosts.
This algorithm performs two operations: encryption and decryption</p><ul><li><strong>Encryption</strong> transforms data (either keys pressed by the sender, or the output from the receiver) into bytes that look random (i.e. one cannot distingush an encrypted text and a random set of bytes).</li><li><strong>Decryption</strong> performs the opposite operation: turns encrypted bytes into plain text.</li></ul><p>The typical <code>ssh</code> command looks like this:</p><pre><code>$ ssh user@ip 
</code></pre><p>For example:</p><pre><code>$ ssh student@141.85.224.100
</code></pre><p>By default, SSH uses port 22.
We can specify another port by using the <code>-p</code> parameter like so:</p><pre><code>$ ssh user@ip -p port
</code></pre><p>This is what you&rsquo;ve been doing for the last 2 sessions in order to log onto our machines and solve challenges:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# ssh ctf@ip -p &lt;some_number&gt;
</code></pre><p>What you did is you created an SSH conection using a custom port which did not open a shell onto our full machines, but onto an individual <a href=#containers>container</a> that was hosting each challenge.
Think of a container as a lighter, albeit less secure VM.
The architecture looks like this:</p><p><img src=./assets/challenge_hosting_architecture.svg alt="Challenge Hosting Architecture"></p><h3 id=udp>UDP</h3><p>We said TCP guarantees the correctness of the delivered data, which is great.
This guarantee, however, comes at the cost of performance.
In the picture above, we saw how ACKs are transmitted.
This mechanism causes a significant temporal overhead, that we sometimes simply cannot afford.
There are services that need to transfer data really fast and, thus, they forgo the need for <strong>datagram</strong> correctness.
As the protocol&rsquo;s name suggests, UDP messages are called datagrams.
If a received packet is incorrect or if it&rsquo;s missing, well&mldr; too bad.
Life moves on&mldr; to the next packet and so on.
So applications usually simply discard incorrect or missing UDP datagrams.
In case you were wondering, UDP also computes the checksum, but provides no mechanism for error handling.
It&rsquo;s up to the application layer to deal with them.</p><p>In short, with UDP, the sender just sends its datagrams to the receiver.
Some might arrive out of order, or corrupted, but this is entirely the receiver&rsquo;s problem.</p><p>Moreover, with the wide implementation of optical fiber around the world, the possibility of datagrams being lost or corrupted has dropped to almost 0.
For this reason, UDP is mostly used for streaming services:</p><ul><li>YouTube</li><li>Netflix</li><li>Discord</li><li>Spotify</li><li>PornHub</li></ul><p>Since an image is worth 1000 words, here&rsquo;s a summary of TCP and UDP:</p><p><img src=./assets/tcp_vs_udp.jpg alt="TCP vs UDP"></p><h2 id=the-application-layer>The Application Layer</h2><p>The layer that is the closest to the user, the application layer is also the one that is hardest to define, since it denotes all network applications.
So we&rsquo;ll try to list but a few examples of applications.
We&rsquo;ve already mentioned some of them in the <a href=#tcp>TCP</a> and <a href=#udp>UDP</a> sections.</p><p>In essence, every app that you use, and which has anything to do with the Internet, is implemented at the application layer.</p><h3 id=netstat><code>netstat</code></h3><p>Netstat is a complex service used for inspecting various networking-related data.
We&rsquo;ll be using it to list the services running on a host.
Now let&rsquo;s test our own Kali Linux host.</p><p>List all running services.
The <code>-a</code> parameter stands for &ldquo;all&rdquo;.</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# netstat -a | less
</code></pre><p>That&rsquo;s quite a lot of them.
Let&rsquo;s trim them down a bit.
For example, let&rsquo;s only list the services running TCP connections.
The <code>-t</code> parameter stands for &ldquo;TCP&rdquo;.
Notice how we can concatenate parameters.
<code>-a -t</code> is equivalent to <code>-at</code> or <code>-ta</code>.</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# netstat -at | less
</code></pre><p>Similarly, we can query all services using UDP connections:
As you might have guessed, UDP connections are listed using the <code>-u</code> parameter.</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# netstat -au  # no need for `less` anymore
</code></pre><p>Now let&rsquo;s look for <strong>servers</strong> specifically.
Usually a server waits for clients to connect to it and send requests.
We say the server <strong>listens</strong> for connections.</p><h3 id=challenge---who-is-111>Challenge - Who is 111?</h3><p>Use the <code>netstat</code>&rsquo;s <code>man</code> page and find the <strong>name of the program</strong> that listens on port <em>111</em>.
The flag of this challenge does <strong>not</strong> respect the format <code>SSS{...}</code>.</p><h2 id=wrap-up>Wrap-up</h2><p>The network stack up to and including the transport layer is implemented by the kernel of most operating systems.
This passes the burden of handling the lower layers of the TCP/IP stack to the OS, leaving the main logic to the application.
This is also helped by the fact that the protocols at the link, internet and transport layers are highly standardised, while there are no real constraints to how applications define protocols they use internally.</p><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>We&rsquo;ve used a lot of acronymes during this session.
Here they are explained once more, in case you missed some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>ACK:</strong> Acknowledgement</li><li><strong>(D)DoS:</strong> (Distributed) Denial of Service</li><li><strong>DHCP:</strong> Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</li><li><strong>DNS:</strong> Domain Name System</li><li><strong>HTML:</strong> HyperText Markup Language</li><li><strong>HTTP(S):</strong> HyperText Transfer Protocol (Secured)</li><li><strong>ICMP:</strong> Internet Control Message Protocol</li><li><strong>IMAP:</strong> Internet Access Message Protocol</li><li><strong>IP:</strong> Internet Protocol</li><li><strong>ISP:</strong> Internet Service Provider</li><li><strong>LAN:</strong> Local Area Network</li><li><strong>MAC:</strong> Media Access Control</li><li><strong>NACK:</strong> Not Acknowledged</li><li><strong>NIC:</strong> Network Interface Card</li><li><strong>OSI:</strong> Open Systems Interconnection</li><li><strong>POP3:</strong> Post Office Protocol version 3</li><li><strong>RTT:</strong> Round-Trip Time</li><li><strong>SMTP:</strong> Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</li><li><strong>SSH:</strong> Secure Shell</li><li><strong>TCP:</strong> Transmission Control Protocol</li><li><strong>TLD:</strong> Top-Level Domain</li><li><strong>UDP:</strong> User Datagrem Protocol</li><li><strong>URI:</strong> Uniform Resource Identifier</li><li><strong>URL:</strong> Uniform Resource Locator</li></ul><p>Here&rsquo;s a short summary of the layers of the TCP/IP stack:</p><ul><li><strong>Link:</strong> Provides us with direct connections to other hosts.

Don&rsquo;t chicken out and crack the password using <code>john</code>.
We&rsquo;ll come back to <code>john</code> when we discuss <a href=../data-security/>Data Security</a>.</p><h3 id=challenge---pinger>Challenge - Pinger</h3><p>The service can ping any IP by running the follwing command:</p><pre><code>$ ping -c 1 &lt;your input&gt;
</code></pre><p>Since your input is given directly to a shell command, you can be creative with how you use it.</p><h2 id=further-reading>Further Reading</h2><h3 id=the-osi-stack>The OSI Stack</h3><p>In the session, we discussed the TCP/IP stack, which is implemented by the kernel of every Operating System (Linux included).
In the early days of the Internet, however, another model was popular.
This was the <strong>OSI Model</strong>.
As a matter of fact, it&rsquo;s still a popular model for teaching about the internet, because it makes a more rigorous separation of what we called the Application Layer.
This layer is split into 3, and the transmission medium is added as a separate physical layer, thus resulting a 7-layer stack.
You can learn about this alternative stack <a href=https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/osi-model/>here</a>, but keep in mind that it is almost never used in practice.</p><h3 id=the-networking-bible>The Networking Bible</h3><p>Speaking of the OSI model, it is paramount that we mention the most influential book in computer networking to this day, namely Andrew Tanenbaum&rsquo;s <a href=http://index-of.es/Varios-2/Computer%20Networks%205th%20Edition.pdf>Computer Networks</a>.
Dating from 1981 (about the time these stacks were first defined), this book has been the cornerstone of networking ever since.
It&rsquo;s a must-read for every netoworking enthusiast.</p><h3 id=icmp>ICMP</h3><p>The protocol used by <code>ping</code> is called <strong>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)</strong>.
The protocol defines a set of <em>utility</em> messages and responses, used by hosts in order to check the status of other hosts.</p><p>There is also a very well-known attack, called <strong>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)</strong>, by which an attacker floods a server with <code>ping</code>s essentially.
The purpose of this attack is to overwhelm the server by making it do nothing else but respond to these <code>pings</code>, rather than serve the actual requests for which it was designed.
Thus, this type of attack aims to render a server useless, or even make it crash.
The attack has been executed in many forms, with one of the simplest being described <a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/>here</a>.</p><h3 id=url-vs-uri>URL vs URI</h3><p>This session you&rsquo;ve learned about <em>URL</em>s, but you might have also heard about <em>URI</em>s.
They&rsquo;re quite similar, but still different.
<a href=https://danielmiessler.com/study/difference-between-uri-url/>Here</a>&rsquo;s the difference explained.</p><h3 id=ipv6>IPv6</h3><p>Since regular IPs (also known as <strong>IPv4</strong>) are 32-bit numbers, there are <code>2^32</code> possible unique IPs.
This number may look large, but it&rsquo;s <em>just</em> 4,294,967,296, so just upwards of 4 billion.
But the world&rsquo;s population is 7.9 billion as of September 2021, and growing.
The pigeonhole principle tells us there are not enough IPs so that every human can be connected to the Internet at the same time.</p><p>For this reason and some others related to the lack of native security of the IP protocol, a new iteration of IPs was designed: <strong>IPv6</strong>.
These new IPs are 128-bit numbers.
<code>2^128</code> is 39 <strong>digits</strong> long, so it should suffice for the entirety of Earth&rsquo;s population (a few times over).</p><p>For a better (but still short) introduction to IPv6, check out <a href=http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/ipv6-guide/>this</a> source.</p><h3 id=dhcp>DHCP</h3><p><strong>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</strong> is a protocol used in order to manage and distribute IP addresses.
Hosts are <em>leased</em> IP addresses from DHCP servers for a limited amount of time.
When an address is about to expire, a host can ask the server to extend the lease.
You can read more about DHCP servers <a href=https://www.infoblox.com/glossary/dhcp-server/>here</a>.</p><h3 id=containers>Containers</h3><p>The main difference between containers and VMs is that VMs use their own separate OS, whereas containers share the OS with the host.
Think about your Kali Linux VM.
It obviously has a separate OS: Kali Linux, duh, while you have your own OS: Windows, Linux, MacOS, whatever.
The operating system inside the VM is called <strong>guest OS</strong>, while the &ldquo;outer&rdquo; OS is called <strong>host OS</strong>.
When it comes to VMs, you need some sort of <em>mediator</em> between the guest and the host.
This mediator is called <strong>a hypervisor</strong>.
In your case, this is VirtualBox.</p><p>This separation between OSs ensures a more secure separation between the two environments.
On the other hand, if a host spawns multiple containers, all of them (host and containers) use the host&rsquo;s OS.
The containers are most importantly separated at the filesystem level.
They can also be allocated more limited resources.
Notice that if you were to use a container for the Security Summer School, you couldn&rsquo;t use Kali Linux unless your host OS were also Kali Linux, which would have been pretty pointless.</p><p><img src=./assets/containers-vs-virtual-machines.png alt="Containers vs VMs"></p><p>However, we use containers to host challenges because our VMs and containers all use Linux and because we can house more containers on the same host (which is itself a VM) than we could VMs.
You can learn more about containers and how to manage them using <code>docker</code> (we also use it for challenges) <a href=https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/>here</a>.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-0812023a93169406cc59e8fd63183f9d>4 -</h1><h1 id=rediscovering-the-browser>(Re)Discovering the Browser</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>In this session we&rsquo;ll zoom in on one of the application-level protocols mentioned in session <a href=../explaining-the-internet/>Explaining the Internet</a>: HTTP.
We&rsquo;ll explain how the browser works and what information to draw from the most widely spoken language on the Internet: HTML.
In addition, we&rsquo;ll also imitate the behaviour of our browser using two highly-versatile commands: <code>curl</code> and <code>wget</code>.</p><h2 id=reminders-and-prerequisites>Reminders and Prerequisites</h2><p>For this session, you&rsquo;ll need:</p><ul><li>a high-level understanding of the TCP/IP stack explained in session <a href=../explaining-the-internet/>Explaining the Internet</a></li><li>an internet connection</li><li>a Firefox/Chrome browser</li><li>a Linux CLI</li></ul><h2 id=web-applications>Web Applications</h2><p>A typical web application is essentially a server.
A server is a host connected to the Internet that <strong>listens</strong> for connections from <strong>clients</strong>.
A client is any application that interacts with the server.
So in short, the server waits for clients to come to it.
The clients are proactive.
They reach out to the server by initiating connections.</p><p><img src=./assets/client-server.svg alt="Web Application Model"></p><h2 id=web-security>Web Security</h2><p>There are 3 main subjects when it comes to web security:</p><ul><li>client-side security (i.e. browser security)</li><li>server-side security</li><li>communications security (i.e. the security of the data while it&rsquo;s travelling from client to server or vice-versa)</li></ul><p>In this track, we&rsquo;ll discuss about server-side security as attacking servers is by far the most rewarding out of the 3 options above.
Since servers communicate with lots of clients, infecting one server can allow an attacker to steal data or even infect the server&rsquo;s clients as well.</p><h3 id=aaa>AAA</h3><p>We say there are 3 A&rsquo;s when it comes to web security (and not only web security):</p><ul><li>Authentication</li><li>Authorisation</li><li>Accounting</li></ul><h4 id=authentication>Authentication</h4><p>Authorisation refers to verifying the client&rsquo;s identity.
It&rsquo;s usually done via requiring the client to submit some credentials such as username and password.
Simply put, authentication takes place whenever you are required to <strong>login</strong> to a website.
The purpose of authentication is obvious: to prevent attackers from <strong>impersonating</strong> legitimate users.</p><p>So authentication means answering the question: &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;
Authentication on its own is not <em>that</em> powerful.
It might allow the server admin to specify which users are allowed to login to a system, but not <em>what they can do</em> once they&rsquo;re logged on that system.</p><h4 id=authorisation>Authorisation</h4><p>In order to have a finer access control, such as specifying that a given user may read some files from the server while others can&rsquo;t, authentication is not enough.
We need a means to <strong>enforce</strong> some security policies like, for example, UNIX-like permissions on the file system.
Authentication helps us identify the user, but we need another &ldquo;A&rdquo;, called <strong>Authorisation</strong> in order to decide what that user may or may not do.</p><p>In short, authorisation answers the question: &ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo;.
It means defining a set of <strong>policies</strong> by which to grant users various kinds of access to different resources.
You can read about the 3 large types of access control types, from which policies derive, <a href=#access-control-types>at the end of this session</a>.</p><h4 id=accounting>Accounting</h4><p>Accounting refers to logging as a means to audit a system.
Logs provide a chronological view of the events that took place on a system / web server.
Using them we can trace and understand attackers better and protect from them in the future.</p><h2 id=hypertext-transfer-protocol-http>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h2><p>As its name implies, HTTP was initially used to transfer text-based data, because when it was proposed in 1991, that&rsquo;s what its creators imagined the Internet was going to be: a collection of text files.
Later versions of HTTP started to accommodate more types of data, including video, audio and even raw bytes.
Nowadays, you can send anything via HTTP.
Still, one of the main things that browsers receive via HTTP is <strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong>.
We&rsquo;ll dive into HTML <a href=#html>a bit later in this session</a>.</p><p>Notice that both HTTP and HTML contain the word &ldquo;HyperText&rdquo;.
It refers to a property of websites to contain <strong>references</strong> to other websites or to other parts of the same website, thus creating a <em>web-like structure of the Intenet</em>, thus the <em>World-Wide Web</em>.
Markdown is another hypertext language.
We use Markdown to write text content for the Security Summer School.
We can use references to <a href=#further-reading>other sections of the same document</a>, or to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQ6UV2onyI">other websites</a> entirely.</p><p>As you may remember from <a href=../explaining-the-internet/>the previous session</a>, HTTP is an application-layer protocol.
This means it sits at the top of the TCP/IP stack and mostly receives and sends user data from and to its underlying transport protocol.
As the transferred data is mostly text, error checking is important.
Thus, the transport-layer protocol used by HTTP is TCP.</p><p>Most websites nowadays use HTTP or HTTPS to transfer data.
Remember the anatomy of a URL, also from <a href=../explaining-the-internet#anatomy-of-a-url>the previous session</a>.</p><p><img src=../explaining-the-internet/assets/url_anatomy.png alt="Anatomy of a URL"></p><p>The first part of a URL is called the <strong>scheme</strong>.
It defines the protocol used for interacting with that website.
In the example above, the scheme is <code>http</code>, i.e. messages to and from the website <code>www.example.com</code> will be passed using HTTP.
By default, HTTP uses port 80 to listen for connections, but we can use any other port we want.
Usually, these ports are in the 8000 - 8099 range to maintain some visual consistency with the original port.</p><p>The <code>http</code> scheme isn&rsquo;t so common now.
Most websites you visit on a daily basis use a different scheme: <code>https</code>.
<code>security-summer-school.github.io</code>, for example, uses HTTPS.</p><h3 id=https>HTTPS</h3><p>HTTPS stands for HTTP <strong>Secure</strong>.
As we&rsquo;re going to see in the <a href=#http-requests-and-responses>next section</a>, HTTP sends data in clear text.
This means that any attacker can intercept network traffic and see what data is being transferred.
HTTPS was developed to remedy this vulnerability.
Instead of being built on top of TCP, HTTPS is built on top of <em>yet another application-level-protocol</em>: <strong>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</strong>.
TLS allows data sent via HTTPS to be encrypted, thus making it unintelligible for attackers.</p><h2 id=requests-and-responses>Requests and Responses</h2><p>HTTP has 4 properties that have allowed it to become ubiquitous in the Internet:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Statelessness:</strong> by default HTTP is a simple request-response protocol maintaining no state between successive communications.
Its design specifies that <strong>every</strong> request is independent from any other.
This is good for designing a web server as it makes it simpler and cleaner, but what if that server is Facebook?
Once you log in, you want it to &ldquo;remember&rdquo; who you are so you can still be logged in after more than 1 click.
A stateless protocol cannot do this.
This shortcoming has led to the design of cookies, which are small pieces of information exchanged between the client and the web application.
They are used to &ldquo;remind&rdquo; the server who the client is upon each request.
We&rsquo;ll discuss cookies in <a href=../hacking-the-web/#cookies>the next session</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Message format:</strong> HTTP requests have a specific format.
Namely, they are comprised of plain-text header and data (although newer improvements also implement a binary protocol).
The header contains various information about the client or the server (e.g. a user-agent, page caching information, text encoding information), while the payload is very often (but not always) an HTML page.</p></li><li><p><strong>Addressing:</strong> resources on the web are located using the URL addressing scheme.
Possible vulnerabilities here include a misconfigured web server that allows viewing application-specific files, or worse, that allows accessing other files on the host machine.
While this information leakage is not very dangerous by itself, it may be used as an intermediary stage for other attacks.
You can read more about URLs <a href=https://skorks.com/2010/05/what-every-developer-should-know-about-urls/>here</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Request methods:</strong> HTTP communication is done by using methods, also called HTTP verbs.
The most used methods are <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code> and <code>DELETE</code>.</p><ul><li>The <code>GET</code> method is read-only and is used to retrieve data from the server.</li><li>A <code>DELETE</code> request is used to remove the specified resource from the server.</li><li>The <code>PUT</code> method is used to modify an entire resource.</li><li><code>POST</code> requests are used to create new resources.</li></ul></li></ol><p>You can find more information about all existing methods <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods>here</a>.</p><p>Communication between a client and a server usually follows these steps:</p><ol><li>A client (a browser) sends an HTTP request to the web.</li><li>A web server receives the request.</li><li>The server runs an application to process the request.</li><li>The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser.</li><li>The client (the browser) receives the response.</li></ol><h3 id=requests>Requests</h3><p><img src=./assets/http-request.png alt="HTTP - Request"></p><p>Here we have a <code>GET</code> request.
It is made for a file: <code>/index.html</code>.</p><p>Remember the <strong>path</strong> from the anatomy of a URL:</p><p><img src=../explaining-the-internet/assets/url_anatomy.png alt="Anatomy of a URL Again"></p><p>This is the file that you request.
The path is like a path in the Linux file system.
In the image above, the request asks for the file <code>/path/to/myfile.html</code>.
So the request would look something like:</p><pre><code>GET /path/to/myfile.html HTTP/1.1
[...]
</code></pre><p>Below the first line in the picture that precedes the anatomy of a URL, we can find the <strong>headers</strong> of the request.
They are metadata used to provide additional information about the connection, about the client and about how to handle the request.
Some usual headers are:</p><ul><li><strong>Host:</strong> indicates the desired host handling the request</li><li><strong>Accept:</strong> indicates what MIME type(s) are accepted by the client; often used to specify JSON or XML output for web-services</li><li><strong>Cookie:</strong> passes cookie data to the server</li><li><strong>Referrer:</strong> page leading to this request (note: this is not passed to other servers when using HTTPS on the origin)</li><li><strong>Authorization:</strong> used for basic auth pages (mainly).
It takes the form &ldquo;Basic &lt;username:password encoded with base64 >&rdquo;
Don&rsquo;t worry about what <code>base64</code> is now.
We&rsquo;ll explain it in the <a href=../data-representation/>Data Representation</a> session.</li><li><strong>Content-Type:</strong> specifies the format of the data
Some examples are:<ul><li><code>text/html</code> for a HTML page</li><li><code>text/plain</code> for plain text</li><li><code>application/json</code> for JSON files</li><li><code>image/jpeg</code> for JPEG images</li></ul></li><li><strong>Content-Length:</strong> specifies the size in bytes of the <strong>body</strong>.
The body is the data that comes along with a request or response.
It is described in some more detail in <a href=#request-body>its own section</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=responses>Responses</h3><p><img src=./assets/http-response.png alt="HTTP - Response"></p><ul><li><code>1xx</code>: informational responses</li><li><code>2xx</code>: the request was fulfilled successfully.
The most common code is <code>200</code>.</li><li><code>3xx</code>: redirects - the request was passed to another server</li><li><code>4xx</code>: client errors.
Some very common client errors are:<ul><li><code>400</code>: <strong>bad request</strong> - there&rsquo;s an error in the request.</li><li><code>404</code>: <strong>not found</strong> - the requested resource doesn&rsquo;t exist.
For example, in case <code>/file.txt</code> doesn&rsquo;t exist and the client sends <code>GET /file.txt HTTP/1.1</code>, the server answers with <code>404</code>.</li><li><code>403</code>: <strong>unauthorised</strong> - you don&rsquo;t have access to that resource.
Let&rsquo;s say the file <code>secret.txt</code> exists, but is only accessible to the <code>admin</code> user.
If a regular user sends <code>GET /secret.txt HTTP/1.1</code>, they would get a <code>403</code> response in return.</li><li><code>405</code>: <strong>method not allowed</strong> - say a server only allows <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> methods.
You would get a <code>405</code> response if you sent it a <code>PUT</code> method, for example.</li></ul></li><li><code>5xx</code>: server errors</li></ul><h4 id=challenge---cockroach>Challenge - Cockroach</h4><p>What methods does the server support?</p><h3 id=query-parameters>Query Parameters</h3><p>This is the last time today that you&rsquo;ll se the image with the anatomy of a URL, we promise.</p><p><img src=../explaining-the-internet/assets/url_anatomy.png alt="Anatomy of a URL Yet Again"></p><p>Look at the <strong>parameters</strong> of the URL
They are highlighted in blue.
Query parameters are key-value pairs that the server can retrieve from the request.
So in our example, the server can see that <code>key1</code> has the value <code>value1</code> and <code>value2</code> corresponds to <code>key2</code>.</p><p>Think of HTTP queries/requests (<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code> etc.) as <strong>functions</strong>.
They return something (the codes explained in the earlier section and sometimes data, like in the case of <code>GET</code>) and might have side effects (<code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code> come to mind here).
Each pair of <strong>path and method</strong> is equivalent to a function.
In any programming language, functions also take arguments.
These arguments are the query parameters of a request.
And just like function arguments, they provide input to the server, values by which the client can alter its behaviour.</p><h4 id=challenge-give-to-get>Challenge: Give to Get</h4><p>Find the correct query parameter with which to get the flag.
The message displayed by the server contains all the hints you need.</p><h3 id=request-body>Request Body</h3><p>Obviously, HTTP requests may also contain raw data.
For example, if we use a <code>POST</code> method, we also have to provide the data to be saved on the server.
Notice that the field <code>Content-Length</code> from the header of the request must contain the length of the <strong>body</strong>.
Otherwise, the server may discard any bytes that exceed the specified <code>Content-Length</code>.</p><h2 id=browsers>Browsers</h2><p>Browsers are the most common type of client for web servers.
They send requests to servers like the ones we outlined <a href=#requests>before</a>.
Servers respond with text files, images, audio files, all kinds of data.
Browsers also store those precious cookies that all websites are eager to give you.
We&rsquo;ll dive deeper into browsers <a href=../hacking-the-web/>next session</a>.</p><p>For now, press <code>Ctrl + u</code> in your browser.
It should lead you to a more weird-looking <a href=view-source:https://security-summer-school.github.io/essentials/rediscovering-the-browser/>version of our website</a>.
This is the HTML code that the browser <strong>renders</strong> in order to display its contents in a more &ldquo;eye-candy&rdquo; fashion (insert images, code snippets, videos etc.).</p><h3 id=html>HTML</h3><p>As we&rsquo;ve <a href=#hypertext-transfer-protocol-http>already established</a>, HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
It&rsquo;s a <strong>description language</strong>, in which the text content of a website is stored.
If you look at view-source:https://security-summer-school.github.io/essentials/rediscovering-the-browser/, you&rsquo;ll find that the sentences in the <code>.html</code> file are the same ase those on <a href=https://github.com/security-summer-school/essentials/blob/master/rediscovering-the-browser/index.md>GitHub</a>.
<code>security-summer-school.github.io</code> is built using <a href=https://github.com/google/docsy-example>Docsy</a>.
Among many other things, Docsy can convert Markdown files to HTML.
This is how we write these sessions in Markdown (another markup language), but you see them in HTML.</p><h4 id=challenge-eyes>Challenge: Eyes</h4><p>Investigate the HTML code of the website and get the flag.</p><h4 id=the-document-object-model-dom>The Document Object Model (DOM)</h4><p>Every HTML file is organised hierarchically by what&rsquo;s called a <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong>.
It connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document, such as the HTML representing a web page, in memory.</p><p>The DOM represents a document as a tree data structure.
Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects.
DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree.
With them, you can change the document&rsquo;s structure, style, or content.</p><p><img src=./assets/dom.png alt=DOM></p><p>Every element within your document is an object: <code>\&lt;head\></code> or <code>\&lt;body\></code> tags etc.
DOMs are flexible and allow easy introduction of nodes, as all objects are nodes.
The DOM can also be used to make changes to the contents of the HTML document, such as creating animations or validating input etc.</p><p>DOM&rsquo;s are outside the scope of the Security Essentials track.
To get a better understanding of DOM&rsquo;s, join the <a href=https://security-summer-school.github.io/web>Web Security track</a> next year.</p><h2 id=browsers-from-the-cli>&ldquo;Browsers&rdquo; From the CLI</h2><p>The browser is all nice and good-looking, but is not so easily configurable.
It&rsquo;s a bit difficult to add your own headers to a request form a browser, for example.
And good luck writing a script that launches subsequent, interdependent browser requests.
When it comes to hacking and crafting very specific HTTP requests, we need to move away from the browser and into the CLI.</p><h3 id=curl><code>curl</code></h3><p>The most versatile CLI tool for creating and sending HTTP requests is by far <code>curl</code>.
It&rsquo;s syntax is at firs really simple:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# curl &lt;URL&gt;
</code></pre><p>To see the full request and response, use the <code>-v</code> parameter:</p><pre><code>root@kali:~# curl -v example.com

</code></pre><p>The request is very simple:</p><pre><code>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
Accept: */*
</code></pre><p>It requests the root of the website, that the client (<code>User-Agent</code>) is <code>curl</code> version <code>7.68.0</code>, and that it accepts any type of response (<code>Accept</code>).</p><p>The server at <code>example.com</code> answers with the code 200, meaning the request was handled smoothly.
It specifies that the delivered content is an HTML file (<code>Content-Type: text/html</code>), with UTF-8 encoding (<code>charset=UTF-8</code>).
If you don&rsquo;t know what UTF-8 is yet, it&rsquo;s a convention on how to encode characters.
We will explain it along with other encodings in session <a href=../data-representation/>Data Representation</a>.
Notice that since the response does contain a body (i. e. the HTML contents of example.com), the <code>Content-Length</code> field is also present and set to the size of the HTML file.</p><p><code>curl</code>&rsquo;s versatility comes from the fact that we can enrich this request by specifying <a href=#query-parameters>query parameters</a> and even a <a href=#request-body>body</a>.</p><h3 id=url-encodings>URL encodings</h3><p>Head over to your browser and search for <code>security; summer ? school</code>.
Take a look at the link in the browser:</p><pre><code>https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-lm&amp;q=security%3B+summer+%3F+school
</code></pre><p>To recap, its query parameters are:</p><ul><li><code>client=firefox-b-lm</code></li><li><code>q=security%3B+summer+%3F+school</code></li></ul><p>The first parameter seems reasonable.
But what&rsquo;s with the weird symbols in the value of <code>q</code>?
Those symbols are the <strong>URL encodings</strong> of <code>;</code> and <code>?</code>.
In order for the value of <code>q</code> not to contain some specific characters used by URLs (such as <code>?</code> to separate the path from the query parameters), those characters are <strong>encoded</strong> differently in the URL.
It&rsquo;s something similar to escaping characters in bash.</p><p>Specifically, in the URL below:</p><ul><li><code>+</code> is the URL encoding for space</li><li><code>%3B</code> is the URL encoding for <code>;</code></li><li><code>%3F</code> is the URL encoding for <code>?</code></li></ul><h3 id=tutorial---readme>Tutorial - Readme</h3><p>The website tells you to click a hyperlink.

</code></pre><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>HTTP is the most widely used protocol for passing data on the Internet.
It is a stateless protocol, meaning that each request is independent from any other request, even for the same resource.
It allows a few specific methods:
- <code>GET</code> - request data from the server
- <code>POST</code> - upload data to the server
- <code>PUT</code> - update data on the server
- <code>DELETE</code> - remove data from the server</p><p>Each request is like a function call across the web and can receive parameters.
In a URL, they are separated from the path by <code>?</code> and from each other by <code>&</code>.
They are key-value pairs such as <code>?user=hacker&role=god</code>.</p><p>The two commands we&rsquo;ve added to our arsenal today are <code>curl</code> and <code>wget</code>:</p><ul><li><code>curl</code>: create and send HTTP requests.

Below are the 3 main access control types, each with a brief description.
For a more in-depth look at these 3, check out <a href=https://www.twingate.com/blog/access-control-models/>this link</a>.
They are not necessarily disjoint. Most applications and operating systems use all 3 types at once for different things.</p><h4 id=discretionary-access-control-dac>Discretionary Access Control (DAC)</h4><p>This is the type of model employed by Linux file permissions.
Each user can decide what permissions to give to other users.
It&rsquo;s easy to implement, but can lead to vulnerabilities because it relies on the fact that users are knowledgeable about security, which is often a far-fetched assumption.</p><h4 id=mandatory-access-control-mac>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</h4><p>While DAC is distributed (every user is free to do as they please with their resources), MAC is the opposite: it involves a third party called <strong>resource monitor</strong> (eg: the OS) that decides who can do what.</p><p>This is the case with sandboxing of iOS/Android apps.
The OS verifies each attempt to access a resource and decides whether to allow it or not.
This model is more complex as it requires a very secure resource monitor, but ensures better security than DAC as it makes fewer assumptions.</p><h4 id=role-based-access-control-rbac>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h4><p>In this role, the subjects (users) may assume different roles and are granted privileges according to their roles rather than according to their user IDs.</p><p>Imagine a student logging onto his school&rsquo;s/university&rsquo;s website.
If they log as a student, they can&rsquo;t access teachers' exam solutions.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
     for the public:

Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License
(&quot;Public License&quot;). To the extent this Public License may be
interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in

     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed

     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws

     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

     License.

  i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  k. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
     commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of
     this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for
     other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital

     no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the
     exchange.

  l. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  m. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  n. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
               NonCommercial purposes only.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
          purposes.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.
       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

  b. ShareAlike.

     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
          license with the same License Elements, this version or
          later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.

       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
          context in which You Share Adapted Material.

       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
     only;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
