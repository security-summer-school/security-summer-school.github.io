# Python does not have a switch instruction.
# In order to create something similar to it, you'll have to use elifs:

elif b == 2:
    print('b = 2')
elif b == 3:
    print('b == 3')
else:

# In order to create more complex if conditions Python does not use && and ||.
# It simply uses the keywords and, or.
if a == 0 and b == 2:
    print('This is a correct if condition: a == 0 and b == 2')
if a == 1 or b == 2:
    print('This is another correct if condition: a == 1 and b == 2')

# Similarly, in order to negate an expression, we use the not keyword.
if not a:  # Equivalent to if (!a) in C
    print('a == 0, thus not a is True')

# To create even more complex boolean expressions you can use parentheses,
# just like you would for arithmetic expressions.
